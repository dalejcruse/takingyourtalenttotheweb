                <h1>Style Sheets for Designers</h1>
                <p>IN THE BEGINNING WAS THE WORD: without style and unadorned on a plain gray background.</p>
                <p>The scientists who envisioned the Web saw it as a place for reasoned discourse conducted through documents whose structure was as logical as the arguments they propounded. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> would present content and structure, and the browser (or <em>User Agent</em>) would interpret it visually, according to its own built-in rules of display. <code class="nopad">&lt;h1>Headlines&lt;/h1></code> would look like whatever the browser decided they should look like (typically, 24<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. Times). <code class="nopad">&lt;p>Paragraphs&lt;/p></code> would look like whatever the browser decided they should look like (typically, 12<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. Times).</p>
                <p>In early browsers such as Mosaic and Netscape 1.0, web page backgrounds were generally gray. Why did browser developers choose this dingy color? The answers are lost in the mists of time. In other words, we have no idea. But we do have a theory. Namely, images seemed to want to appear against a black background for maximum contrast and impact. Text, of course, wanted to appear on white. We’re guessing that the makers of the first browsers compromised by giving us a washed-out gray that would provide rudimentary contrast for either type of foreground element. Regardless of their reasons, the resulting web pages were not much to look at.</p>
                <h2>Tag Soup and Crackers</h2>
                <p>Designers and their clients, however, were not about to sit still for such limited presentational capabilities, so browser companies (mainly Netscape at first) began "extending" <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> willy-nilly to offer web designers more control over the visual appearance of their sites. Netscape extended the <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> tag, allowing us to choose background colors as well as text and link colors. Microsoft gave us proprietary <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> tag extensions that allowed us to create margins of a limited sort.</p>
                <p>Netscape gave us the <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tag. We could control the size of our text, regardless of its structural context. (We could, for instance, make paragraphs really big <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE="7"></code> and headlines really small <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE="1"></code> even if such approaches contradicted the underlying document structure.) Microsoft gave us the <code class="nopad">&lt;FACE></code> attribute for the <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tag. We could control typography in a limited, Flintstonian fashion. <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></code> would make text on the page appear in Arial if the visitor’s operating system offered that font. If not, the text would appear as Helvetica. If neither font were available, visitors would see their default typeface (probably Times).</p>
                <p>While browser companies corrupted <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in a well-meaning but wrong-headed effort to serve designers and their clients, designers began setting their text in Photoshop and saving the images in web-friendly <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format. 14<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. Meta or Futura, with precise kerning and leading, looked a lot better than <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT FACE="ARIAL, HELVETICA"></code>. Instead of using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to present text, designers used it to embed visual representations of text.</p>
                <p>What we gained in presentational spiffiness, we lost in usability. <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images of text could not be searched, indexed, copied, or pasted. They could not even be seen by some people or in some browsers.</p>
                <p>At the same time, designers began using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables to control their layouts, a practice most of us still follow, though it runs counter to the structural nature of HTML. The practice has another downside as well: It yokes our presentation to our content, making it harder or even impossible for those with disabilities or those using nontraditional browsers to access the information on our sites.</p>
                <p>Many of us went beyond using tables and text images. We harnessed invisible powers to our task. As you know, in Photoshop any layer may be fully or partially transparent. Images in the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format are limited to 256 (or fewer) colors, any one of which may be designated as transparent. Using Photoshop, web designers created small (1 pixel by 1 pixel) <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s filled with a single, transparent color. We then used these transparent <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images to control the positioning of elements on the page, as if we were designing for a fixed medium like print.</p>
                <p>We used these transparent <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images again to simulate leading, inserting "spacer <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s" between lines of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text.</p>
                <p><code>&lt;IMG WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100" ALT=" " SRC="transparent.gif"></code></p>
                <p>Notice the height and width. Netscape’s browser likes it when you indicate the size of images used. This helps the browser leave space for the images, even before they have finished downloading. A tangential aspect of the whole affair is that browsers will display your images at any size you tell them to. Thus a 1 pixel by 1 pixel <span class="orange">transparent.gif</span> could be 100 pixels wide by 100 pixels tall if you marked it up that way in your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. These crude feats provided rudimentary layout control, while <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> itself did not.</p>
                <p>That was the key. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, practically the only tool at our disposal, provided no typographic or layout control. So most of us deliberately deformed the simple markup language in hopes of forcing it do our bidding. We made a "tag soup" of the Web, using <code class="nopad">&lt;TT></code> ("typewriter text") to force the browser to display a monospaced font (usually Courier). To create vertical space, we deployed transparent <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>S or typed structurally meaningless carriage returns such as:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;br></code></p>
                <p>or went so far as to create "invisible headlines" which were never intended to be read. To create invisible headlines we used the nonstandard <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT COLOR></code> attribute to set a headline to the same color as the web page’s background. For example, on a page whose background color was white, we might use the following:</p>
                <p><code class="nopad">&lt;H1>&lt;FONT COLOR="#FFFFFF">Don’t read this headline&lt;/FONT>&lt;/H1></code></p>
                <p>By means of these stunts, the Web began to look better on the surface, but the markup that was supposed to hold it together was becoming less and less meaningful, more and more fragmented. Documents made less and less structural sense and were more and more tied to the quirks of specific browsers. "Use Netscape so you can see this page!" we screamed at our viewers in the mid-1990s.</p>
                <h2><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to the Rescue…Sort of</h2>
                <p>In 1996, Microsoft, Netscape, and other members of the World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>) came up with a brilliant new standard technology—one intended to give designers far more power over the display of web pages, without further corrupting the structural meaning of their <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents. The name of that technology was Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>).</p>
                <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is the best friend a visually oriented web designer ever had, but support for this crucial standard has been a long time coming. In the following section, we’ll gently introduce you to <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, showing how and why it works. Afterward, we’ll talk about what can go wrong with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and present a detailed No Fault <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Plan that enables you to harness the power of style sheets without running afoul of buggy browsers. The good news about all of this is that most current web browsers now offer good-to-excellent <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support. The bad news is that older, inferior browsers are still in use, though they are fading away over time (see the section, "The 18-Month Pregnancy" in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, "Designing for the Medium," for comments on this topic).</p>
                <p>As a last prefatory note, you might find yourself working at a large web agency—one where web designers spend most of their time in Photoshop and Illustrator, while <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> production chores are handled by a separate group of professionals. Even at job like that, you will still need to know <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Why? It’s because even when <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> chores are assigned to web technicians, it is almost always the web designer’s job to create the style sheet.</p>
                <p>That may seem puzzling. If web technicians and developers handle all other markup and coding, why wouldn’t those professionals also be called upon to write the site’s style sheet? The answer is simple—style sheets control typography and layout, and that makes them the designer’s responsibility. (You don’t really want a programmer deciding how your web typography should look, do you?)</p>
                <h2>Designing with Style: Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>)</h2>
                <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is a developing web standard whose purpose is to control the display of web pages. Cascading Style Sheets Level 1, the initial version of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> recommended by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> in 1996, is well (or fairly well) supported in current browsers including Opera 5 or higher, Internet Explorer 5 or higher, and Netscape 6 or higher. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> empowers web designers to control such elements as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Font families, font sizes, and leading ("line-height" in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-speak)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Margins and page divisions</span></li>
                    <li><span>Colors, backgrounds, whether or not backgrounds tile, whether or not they scroll, and so on</span></li>
                    <li><span>Positioning of elements in relation to each other, and to the edges of the browser window</span></li>
                    <li><span>Borders, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> elements (such as <code class="nopad">&lt;FORM></code> elements), and more</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>As this list suggests, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is a very powerful standard that can replace the use of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables to control layout; end the use of <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags to control web typography; and do much more than tables and <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags ever could (see Figure 10.1).</p>

The background image, text, and "core" button are exactly positioned via <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, which also creates the black outline and background colors. Notice that the image hugs the upper left corner of the browser window, a feat that is easily achieved by using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to set margins and padding at "0." JavaScript was used to route Netscape 6 users, <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 users, and Opera 5 users to subtly different pages (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240753/http://www.zeldman.com/2001.html" title="Check out what zeldman.com/2001 looked like back in 2001.">www.zeldman.com/2001<wbr>.html</a>).</p>

                <h3 class="clearfix">Separation of Style from Content</h3>
                <p>Beyond providing designers with a powerful tool set, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> serves an additional purpose—that of formally separating a website’s <em>style</em> (or design elements) from its <em>content</em> (otherwise known as writing and such).</p>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Traditional Web Design Methods</h3>
                <p>The way web designers have historically designed pages, style and content are hopelessly intermingled. Text appears inside table cells. <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags are wrapped around every paragraph.</p>
                <p>While this old system works, and while it is used in literally millions of sites, it has two powerful disadvantages:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span><strong>Problems in the present: wasted bandwidth and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> abuse.</strong> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables were never intended to be used as design tools; when used for that purpose, they slow the rendering of web pages in the browser and can cause problems for users of text-based browsers—such as people with disabilities. While they do work in most browsers, these tags and tricks slow down web pages and contribute to bandwidth problems by forcing the user to download unnecessary text (namely, the tags themselves). They also clutter the markup.</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Problems for the future: retarding progress.</strong> By mingling content with style, the present system makes it much more difficult for web designers and programmers to create sites that can be used by non-graphical browsers and devices, such as web phones, Personal Digital Assistants (<abbr title="Personal Digital Assistants">PDAs</abbr>), and audio browsers for the blind. Such devices represent a growing and vital market. On the other hand, if content and style are formally separated, then nongraphical browsers can simply display text and links, while computer users with graphical browsers still enjoy a rich visual experience created by web designers. In addition to the harmful effects on web-enabled devices, the mingling of content and style also makes it more difficult to design and build robust interactive sites, including the e-commerce sites you will inevitably find yourself designing.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h3><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Advantages: Short Term</h3>
                <p>Under the present system, designers who wish to control the appearance of text on the Web must type <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags for every paragraph of client content. This adds up to hundreds of kilobytes of wasted bandwidth on every site and hundreds of hours of tedious labor for the web designer and/or the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> technician.</p>
                <p>After all those hours of labor, if the client requests a design change, many more hours of labor must be put in, as the designer or web technician manually searches for and replaces all those annoying <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags.</p>
                <p>It’s a dumb way to work. With style sheets, the web designer can change just one document—a global style sheet—and the layout and typography of the entire site will be instantly changed. Hundreds of hours of the dullest sort of labor can be saved in this way. If style sheets are used to control layout as well as typography, the savings in labor (and client costs) can be even more profound.</p>
                <p>What can you do with the client dollars saved? You can spend them on design, programming, writing, photography, illustration, research, testing, marketing, and maintenance. With less of it wasted on monkey work, the same budget now enables you to create a richer, more powerful site.</p>
                <p>Another bonus is that after putting every ounce of our experience and talent into the design of web pages, we typically turn the sites over to our clients, who then update the sites as needed. Websites are not carved in stone; a site that’s not minty-fresh is a dead site. How many clients have a background in design and extensive knowledge of web technology? We’ve been lucky enough to find precisely one such client in nearly six years of doing this work.</p>
                <p>As explained in <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, "Riding the Project Life Cycle," often during the hand-off and maintenance phase, a junior or mid-level person with no design experience and little web knowledge is made responsible for the site’s maintenance and updating. Frequently, "refreshing the site" is merely one of that employee’s daily duties. The more our pages are filled with <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags, complex tables and framesets, the sooner that overworked web coordinator can turn the site into an eyesore as well as a usability nightmare. By separating design elements from content, we make it much harder for our clients to destroy the sites we’ve worked so hard to create for them. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is our friend.</p>
                <h3><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Advantages: Long Term</h3>
                <p>As indicated, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> provides a way for web designers to create richly visualized, robustly interactive sites that also might function well outside the traditional web browser environment. As more and more people begin to interact with the Web through new, nontraditional Internet devices—and as more and more powerful web standards are brought to fruition in the browser as well as at the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> bargaining table—the need to separate content from style becomes even more important. So it’s pretty darned crucial that web designers come to grips with this concept of style/content separation and learn to use style sheets effectively in designing for the Web.</p>
                <h2>Compatibility Problems: an Overview</h2>
                <p>The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-1 standard was created in 1996 but was not completely supported by any web browser before the year 2000. As of this book’s publication, it is still imperfectly supported by browsers most often used to access the Web. This has slowed the adoption of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in the field given that no client wishes to pay for a site that might not work correctly for many users.</p>
                <p>Poor, partial, or incompatible <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> implementations in browsers also have persuaded most web designers who do use style sheets to employ them only in very limited ways. For example, many designers now use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to control the fonts on a site. But these same designers continue to use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables to control the layout of text and graphical elements on each page (see Figure 10.2) because poor or incompatible <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> implementations in the browser might otherwise render their layouts illegible. They can even cause one browser to crash (more on that shortly).</p>

Because Netscape 4 users can crash from <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> layouts and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 users can barely see them, an interim approach was taken. When these old browsers have faded into disuse, the same page will be designed entirely in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191752/http://www.zeldman.com/coming.html" title="Check out what zeldman.com/coming looked like back in 2001.">www.zeldman.com/comin<wbr>g.html</a>).</p>

                <p class="clearfix">We refer to this two-pronged, "safe" approach as <em>No-Fault <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr></em>, a technique we began recommending in 1998 in the <em>A List Apart</em> "Fear of Style Sheets" series:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>The series was designed to evangelize <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> use in spite of browser compliance problems by showing which <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> techniques to avoid and which could be safely used.</p>
                <p>Browser companies such as Netscape and Microsoft have sometimes been slow to realize that what is good for designers and web users is also good for browser makers themselves because fewer problems mean fewer complaints and better word of mouth. Nevertheless, by fits and starts, the browser companies have increasingly supported <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in earnest. Eventually, web designers will be able to dispense with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables and other forms of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> abuse altogether and use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to design robust sites that conserve bandwidth while offering true separation of style from content.</p>
                <p>In turn, this separation of style from content will enable designers, programmers, and web technicians to more capably use additional web standards, such as JavaScript and the Document Object Model (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>), to build truly dynamic, interactive sites.</p>
                <h2>Working with Style Sheets</h2>
                <p>Style sheets are composed of "rules." Rules have two parts: a selector that is followed by a declaration. Consider the style sheet below:</p>
                <p><code>BODY {background: white; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;}<br>
                    H1 {font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;}<br>
                    P, LI {font-size: 12px; line-height: 150%;}</code></p>
                <p><span class="orange">BODY</span> is the first selector, while the text within brackets is the declaration. Each declaration consists of one or more properties, followed by its associated values. For example, in the first line, <span class="orange">background</span> is a property, and <span class="orange">white</span> is declared as its value. <span class="orange">font-family</span> is a property, and the fonts listed are possible values for that property. This terminology is confusing at first, but working with style sheets is actually very easy. Let’s look more closely at the following example:</p>	
                <p><code>BODY {margin-top: 0; background: white; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;}<br> 
                    H1 {font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;}<br>
                    P, LI {font-size: 12px; line-height: 150%;}</code></p>
                <p>The first line indicates that the <span class="orange">BODY</span> of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document will use a white background and that typography throughout the entire page (unless otherwise noted via an additional selector) will be in the Helvetica family. If the user does not have Helvetica on his or her system, the type will be displayed in Arial. If Arial is not available, a generic sans serif will be used. Finally, <span class="orange">margin-top: 0</span> tells the browser to start the web page at the top of the browser window, rather than "helpfully" offsetting it with an unpredictable or inconsistent vertical margin.</p>	
                <p>Font families are displayed in the order with which they are written. If the user has both Arial and Helvetica on her system, Helvetica will be displayed because it is listed first. In this way it is possible for designers to specify "best-case" scenarios while providing backup options. Remember: The first font listed will be displayed if it is available. The old <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tag worked the same way.</p>
                <p>It is crucial to provide typographic alternatives to compensate for cross-platform differences and to end every font declaration with a generic alternative, such as "serif" or "sans serif." Additional generic alternatives include "monospace" for monospaced fonts such as Courier and "fantasy" for ugly and cancerous fonts such as Microsoft Comic Sans.</p>
                <p>Recognize the awesome power of style sheets. <em>In a single line, the typeface has been provided for an entire site.</em> Imagine typing all those <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT FACE="HELVETICA, ARIAL, SANS-SERIF"></code> tags instead. Yuck.</p>
                <p><code>BODY {margin-top: 0; background: white; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;}</code></p>
                <p>Note also that the background color has been written out as "white." Any color may be used, though as has been discussed before, it is always best to use web-safe colors.</p>
                <p>Colors need not and usually should not be specified by name because names do not necessarily trigger web-safe colors. Instead of white, the designer could have specified the hexadecimal code for that color: <span class="orange">#ffffff</span>. It is even possible to use "shorthand" and specify only the first letter of each hexadecimal pair (<span class="orange">#fff</span>). This will be clearer with a color such as <span class="orange">#ff9900</span>, which can be written as <span class="orange">#f90</span> in the style sheet, saving the designer three strokes of the keyboard and saving the user an infinitesimal amount of bandwidth.</p>
                <p>Note that the <span class="orange">H1</span> (headline), <span class="orange">P</span> (paragraph), and <span class="orange">LI</span> (list item) have had their sizes specified in pixels:</p>
                <p><code>H1 {font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;}<br> 
                    P, LI {font-size: 12px; line-height: 150%;}</code></p>
                <p>It is possible (though not always useful) to specify a size of 1<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> or 200<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> (or even larger type). Besides pixels, style sheets can use points, inches, centimeters, .ems, percentages ("<span class="orange">font-size: 75%;</span>") and even absolute font size keywords. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each further on in the chapter. Oh, brother, will we discuss them.</p>
                <p>Note also that it is possible to specify bold (or light, or italic, or italic bold) and that for the first time in web design history, it is also possible to create Quark-like leading in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text. Okay, you’re new to web design, so you’re not impressed. We’ve had leading in desktop publishing tools since Nixon wore short pants—but not on the Web, sister. On the Web, this is some cool new stuff.</p>
                <p><code>line-height: 150%</code></p>
                <p>This declaration means that the text will have leading of 150%. Any number may be chosen. Line-height can be 110%, 200%, or 75% (for special effects involving overlapping text). Assume 100% as a default, which need not be written. (Actually, the built-in leading seems to be closer to 110%, but again, unless you are specifying leading for a reason, leave it out to avoid creating problems.)</p>
                <p>Line-height, like font-size, can be specified in points, pixels, .ems, percentages, centimeters, or inches.</p>
                <p><code>line-height: 18px;</code></p>
                <p>Because 150% of 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> equals 18<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> (12 + 6 = 18), a line-height of 18<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> would look exactly the same as a line-height of 150% on 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> type. If the font-size were 24<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr>, then 150% would yield a line-height of (24 + 12) 36 pixels.</p>
                <p>It is also possible and often desirable to indicate font-size and line-height in the same declaration, using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> shorthand:</p>
                <p><code>P, LI {font: 12px/18px;}</code></p>
                <p>The first number (<span class="orange">12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr></span>) is the font-size; the second (<span class="orange">18<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr></span>) is the line-height. All <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-capable browsers understand this shorthand.</p>
                <p>Leading on the Web serves exactly the same purpose as leading in print: it adds air to the "page" and enhances readability. On the screen-based Web, with its low typographic resolution, anything we can do to encourage readability is all right by us. By contrast, reading may be discouraged when we fail to apply leading and other <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> niceties to our text (see Figure 10.3).</p>

                        <p>The Adobe web column, written by your humble author, but laid out by Adobe’s online design team. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is used to control typography, but the small text is tough on the eyes. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> leading and a larger font-size would make the reading experience more pleasurable. This typographic approach works well for image captions, a staple of the Adobe site, but it is less well-suited to longish articles (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040105/http://www.adobe.com" title="Check out what adobe.com looked like back in 2001.">www.adobe.com</a>).</p>

                <p class="clearfix">Now that we’ve taken a brief look at the rudiments of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, let’s see how web designers can make this work on a site.</p>
                <h3>Types of Style Sheets</h3>
                <p>There are three main ways to use style sheets on a website:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>By linking to an external stylesheet from the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document</span></li>
                    <li><span>By embedding a stylesheet within each <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document</span></li>
                    <li><span>By adding styles inline in an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Additionally, it is possible to import one style sheet into another. Unfortunately, this technique is not supported by Netscape Navigator 4, so we will confine our discussion to the first three items. If Netscape 4 has gone to its reward by the time you buy this book, you can read up on "<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> import" at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101270126/http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/#browsers" title="Check out what w3.org/Style/CSS looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/Style/CSS/</a>.</p>
                <h4>External style sheets</h4>
                <p>Linking to an external style sheet enables you control multiple web pages (or even an entire site) using a single <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> document. The more pages controlled by the same <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> document, the easier it becomes to make design changes to that site. It is literally possible to change the appearance of a 5,000-page website in under a minute, simply by editing one external Style sheet. Trust us, this is one maintenance chore you will genuinely enjoy.</p>
                <h5>Five steps to paradise: creating an external style sheet</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Essentially, in BBEdit, PageSpinner, HomeSite, or any other <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor, the designer creates a style sheet. For simplicity’s sake, here is a basic one:<br>
                        <code>BODY {background: white; font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;}<br>
                        H1 {font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;}<br>
                        P, LI {font-size: 12px; line-height: 150%;}</code></span></li>
                    <li><span>The designer saves this document with a filename ending in .css. For instance, the name could be style.css, or clientname.css.</span></li>	
                    <li><span>This <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file is then uploaded to the server via <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>, just like an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Next, in the website’s <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files, the designer inserts one additional line of code within the <code class="nopad">&lt;HEAD></code> tag:
                        <p>
                            <code>&lt;html><br>
                            &lt;head><br>
                            &lt;title>Welcome to Widgets.com&lt;/title><br>
                            &lt;link rel="stylesheet" HREF="style.css" TYPE="text/css"><br>
                            &lt;/head><br>
                            &lt;body></code>
                        </p>
                        …and so on.</span></li>
                    <li><span>The <code class="nopad">&lt;link></code> tag calls up the separate sylesheet file (style.css) and uses its contents as instructions for displaying the page.</span></li>	
                </ol>
                <p>Note that it is possible to link to a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> file using a relative path ("../styles/ style.css"), a rooted <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> ("/path/from/server/root/style.css"), or a full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> (http://www.widgets.com/styles/style.css). This style sheet will now control any web page that links to it via the additional line of code within the <code class="nopad">&lt;HEAD></code> tag. An entire site can be controlled in this way.</p>
                <h5>Embedding a style sheet</h5>
                <p>Web designers who wish to affect only one page may do so by embedding a style sheet within the <code class="nopad">&lt;HEAD></code> tag of that web page.</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;html><br>
                        &lt;head><br>
                        &lt;title>Style Sheets Rule!&lt;/title><br>
                        &lt;style type="text/css"><br>
                        &lt;!--<br>
                        BODY {background: #ffc; font-family: palatino, georgia, times new roman, serif;}<br> 
                        P {font-size: small; line-height: 125%;}<br>
                        .sub {font: large bold arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-top: .25in;}<br>
                        --><br>
                        &lt;/head>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Note the use of commenting to prevent older, non-<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-capable browsers from being confused by the code and to prevent search engines from pointlessly indexing your style sheet:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;!--</code></p>
                <p>(Anything within comments will be ignored by browsers that do not understand the code, and ignored as well by search engines. Have a nice day.)</p>
                <p><code>--></code></p>
                <p>What else is new in this example? The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is preceded by a tag that tells the browser how to interpret it:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;style type="text/css"></code></p>
                <p>A more complete heading tells the browser not only that what follows is an embedded <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, but also tells what type of media the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is intended to support:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;link REL="StyleSheet" HREF="style.css" TYPE="text/css" MEDIA="screen"></code></p>
                <p>The idea is that a document can link to several style sheets. For instance, one controls screen presentation (<span class="orange">MEDIA="screen"</span>), another printing, and a third audio browsers. Not all browsers support this as of now, though it’s a good idea to begin fully spec’ing your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> anyway.</p>
                <h6>In a Class by Itself</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>All of the preceding is straightforward, but what does <span class="orange">.sub</span> mean in this line?</p>
                    <p><code>.sub {font: large bold arial, helvetica, sans-serif; margin-top: .25in;}</code></p>
                    <p>The selector labeled <span class="orange">.sub</span> is a unique class, created by the web designer for his or her own particular design needs on this page.</p>
                    <p>That’s correct. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> not only gives web designers the power to style traditional <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup, it also enables them to create and style unique items to suit their needs.</p>
                    <p>For instance, here, the web designer wished to create a special subhead class with a quarter-inch margin at the top. She decided to call it <span class="orange">sub</span> because the name was easy to remember and indicated the purpose (subhead) for which the class was created. The designer could have called this class <span class="orange">unclecharlie</span> if she wished.</p>
                    <p>To make use of this special class, the web designer will refer to it in the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document in this way:</p>
                    <p><code>&lt;div class="sub">Here is my subhead, with a quarter-inch margin at the top.&lt;/div></code></p>
                    <p>In the web page, the line, <span class="orange">Here is my subhead, with a quarter-inch margin at the top</span> would be large, bold, Arial or Helvetica (or generic sans serif) with (surprise!) a quarter-inch margin at the top.</p>
                    <p>Style sheets rock.</p>
                </div>
                <h5>Adding styles inline</h5>
                <p>The inline method is used when the web designer wishes to change the appearance of a single tag or group of tags on one page, and not for changing the entire page or site. Adding styles inline does not offer web designers the true power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> because it forces them to restyle text one item at a time. Still, it can be very useful at times.</p>
                <p>For instance, an entire page or site may be set in medium-size Verdana (Helvetica, Arial, sans serif). But one line of text needs to stand out from the rest. Perhaps this line of text represents a letter from a customer—or a message from the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Internal Revenue Service. The web designer decides that this particular line of text should be set in 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> Monaco.</p>
                <p>She could create an entire class just for that line of text and include that class in the site’s global style sheet, but why create an entire class for one line of text on a single web page? Inline styling does the job better:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;p style="font: 12px monaco, monospace;"><br> 
                    Greetings from the I.R.S.&lt;/p></code></p>
                <p>Inline styling seems like an oddity, but it is actually a wonderful supplemental tool—much like a tube of touch-up paint that is used to correct a small detail.</p>
                <p>Inline styling is also quite effective for improving the appearance of <code class="nopad">&lt;FORM></code> elements:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;div align="center"><br>
                        &lt;form><br>
                        &lt;input type="button" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: geneva, arial; background-color: #ff6600; color: #ffffff;" value="Previous Reports" onClick="window.location=’com0400d.html’;" onMouseOver="window.status=’More of same.’; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=’’;return true;"><br>
                        &lt;/form><br>
                        &lt;/div>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Form elements also may be styled via DIV classes in a global style sheet. If every <code class="nopad">&lt;FORM></code> button on your site is supposed to be orange (<span class="orange">#ff6600</span>) and use 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> Geneva or Arial type, by all means create an <span class="orange">orangebutton</span> class for the site, declare it on the global style sheet, and then refer to it in individual <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages, like so:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;div align="center"><br> 
                        &lt;form><br>
                        &lt;input type="button" class="orangebutton" value="Previous Reports" onClick="window.location=’com0400d.html’;" onMouseOver="window.status=’More of same.’; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=’’;return true;"><br>
                        &lt;/form><br>
                        &lt;/div>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <h2>Trouble in Paradise: <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Compatability Issues</h2>
                <p>The first web browser to attempt to support <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> was Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 (1997). It supported about 30% of the standard. A year later, Netscape 4 came out with support that was marginally better than that of <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3. During three years of hell, while Netscape sought to rebuild its browser from the ground up, Navigator 4 sat rotting on the market—its once-proud <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support looking more and more shoddy. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>4 got more of it right and was soon replaced by <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5, which got still more of it right. No browser got it absolutely right, and baffled web users were often reluctant to upgrade to incremental (4.52 anybody?) versions of these browsers.</p>
                <p>Thus support for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> lagged, and problems abounded. In 1998, The Web Standards Project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050037/http://webstandards.org" title="Check out what webstandards.org looked like back in 2001.">www.webstandards.org</a>) was formed to advocate and shore up support for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and other web standards, and <em>A List Apart</em> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182141/http://www.alistapart.com" title="Check out what alistapart.com looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com</a>) began running the "Fear of Style Sheets" series.</p>
                <h3>Fear of Style Sheets: <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and Layout</h3>
                <p>One of the great strengths of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is its ability to position elements on a web page. Elements may be positioned by exact pixel coordinates (400 pixels from the top, 32 pixels from the left, for example). They may be positioned relative to each other. They may be positioned via percentages, permitting web designers to easily set up liquid layouts, as previously discussed.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> positioning is not supported in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 and is poorly supported in Netscape Navigator 4. In fact, it can cause the browser to crash, as detailed in <em>A List Apart</em>’s article, "The Day The Browser Died" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20000816004024/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/died" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/died looked like back in 2000.">www.alistapart.com/stories/died/</a>).</p>
                <p>So until <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 and Netscape 4 leave the market, many of us will probably keep using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables to create our web layouts. Web pages laid out with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables will work in Netscape 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6; in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 2, 3, 4, 5 and beyond; and in all other graphical browsers, including Opera and iCab.</p>
                <p>If you’ve been following along, you’ll realize this means that web designers still cannot safely separate style from content on commercial projects and will continue to face difficulties in creating sites that work well outside the traditional desktop computer-based browser. But in the trenches, where work gets done, it also means that we can create sites that work for our clients and our clients’ audiences.</p>
                <p>By late 2001 or soon after, we should be free to truly harness the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Meanwhile, on personal, noncommercial projects, we can explore the full potential of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and other web standards without fear of hurting our clients’ customers (see Figure 10.4). It is hoped that these noncommercial usages of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and other web standards help widen interest in emerging technologies and encourage quicker adoption of newer, more standards-compliant browsers.</p>

                        <p>Web Trumps, a card game featuring well-known web personalities, uses <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to control the positioning and layering of every image on the page and JavaScript to reveal new layers during game play. Web Trumps is a mini-masterpiece of graphic design and web programming—but one requiring the use of a modern browser. Experiments like this help hasten the day web designers can apply the same level of sophistication to commercial designs without worrying about browser incompatibilities (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101232159/http://www.pixelflo.com/008" title="Check out what pixelflo.com/008 looked like back in 2001.">http://pixelflo.com/008/</a>).</p>

                <h3 class="clearfix">Fear of Style Sheets: Leading and Image Overlap</h3>
                <p>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> leading provides a standard means of improving the legibility and aesthetics of textual presentations on the Web—something every site designer should care about. And it does this while avoiding all the problems associated with transparent <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> hacks and other nonstandard visual workarounds.</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> line-height property solves all the old problems, but it can lead to new ones, particularly in older browsers whose support for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is largely theoretical. For instance, in the following example, if <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> line-height is specified for the <code class="nopad">&lt;p></code> tag, the image will float on top of the text in both <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 and early versions of Navigator 4:</p>
                <p><code class="nopad">&lt;p>&lt;img src="dog.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="My dog, Pookie." title="Pookie is a friendly mutt." align="left">My dog Pookie liked this text so much, he decided to sit on it in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 and Navigator 4.&lt;/p></code></p>
                <p>This problem is more prevalent in Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> than in Windows, largely because big browser companies spend more time and resources developing browsers for Windows than for other operating systems. (All the more miraculous then, that in the year 2000 the best browser on the market was <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac. Arguably it is still the best.) The solution to image overlap is to keep images outside of paragraphs and <code class="nopad">&lt;div></code> tags. Unfortunately, doing so brings up yet another problem in Netscape Navigator 4:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>&lt;img src="dog.gif" width="100" height="100" alt="My dog, Pookie." Title="Pookie is a friendly mutt." align="left"><br>
                    &lt;p>My dog Pookie liked this text so much, he decided to shove it to the right in its own little column in Navigator 4.&lt;/p></code></p>
                <p>With a left-aligned image placed outside the <code class="nopad">&lt;p>&lt;/p></code>, some versions of Netscape Navigator 4 will stick all the paragraph text in an imaginary column to the right of the image, as if the web designer had desired to create such a column. New paragraphs, in turn, will appear also in that unwanted column. Many a simple layout has been ruined in this way.</p>	
                <p>There is no solution to this problem. No matter which approach is used, some Netscape 4 users are going to get an ugly layout. Because an unwanted and mindlessly stupid column is preferable to text that is hidden behind an image, it is best to hope and pray that most Netscape 4.x users are equipped with a more recent version of the browser. Alternately, the designer can create pages that use no images whatsoever—scarcely an attractive option. Finally, the designer can wrap images inside table cells, given that doing so seems to solve most of these problems—at the terrible cost of adding needless, bandwidth-wasting and time-consuming code to every single web page.</p>
                <p>The good news of course is that Netscape 6 avoids all these problems, and Netscape 4, like other old browsers, will gradually wither away. The bad news is it hasn’t withered away yet. So proceed with caution.</p>
                <h3>Fear of Style Sheets: <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and Typography</h3>
                <p>Guerrilla warfare pays little heed to niceties and neither can designers in the trenches. Too much of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> still does not work in millions of web users’ browsers. To prepare you for battle, we will now pay little heed to the way things should work. Instead, we will show you what does work in any <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-capable browser, no matter how old, inadequate, or semi-standards-compatible it is. In other words, the following is an interim strategy for use until nearly all web users are packing a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-compliant browser. If you wish to control your web typography with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (and why wouldn’t you wish to do that?), there are only two things that always work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Use pixels (not points, not .ems, not percentages, not keywords) to specify your font sizes.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Or use nothing. Do not specify font sizes at all, and let the browser’s stylistic defaults and the visitor’s preferences take care of the relative size relationships. This approach is detailed in the "Dao of Web Design" article at <em>A List Apart</em> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010417000022/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/dao" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/dao looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com/stories/dao/</a>)</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Promise and performance</h4>
                <p>By now you understand that <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is an important standard. It allows web designers to specify the font family, size, margins, and leading of type on the web; permits web designers to create advanced web layouts without abusing <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; and enables web designers, web practitioners, and programmers to separate design elements (presentation) from content.</p>
                <p>This ability to separate presentation from content theoretically empowers us to create attractive sites without excluding visitors who cannot use graphical browsers—a highly desirable goal. It also paves the way for the expansion of the Web beyond the desktop computer and onto a variety of hand-held and other Internet-enabled devices.</p>
                <p>Yet many times our best <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> efforts fail in one browser or another.</p>
                <p>Even though the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Level 1 standard was finalized in 1996, the first browser to meaningfully support it did not appear until the year 2000 (Internet Explorer 5, Macintosh Edition). Fortunately, Netscape 6 (multiple platforms), Opera 5 (multiple platforms), and Konqueror (Linux/UNIX) soon followed, with commendable <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support of their own. But each of these fine browsers enjoys only a relatively small market share as of this writing.</p>
                <p>At present, the market is dominated by <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> for Windows—a browser that comes teasingly close but misses the mark in a few critical areas. The Windows version of Microsoft’s browser did not fully support <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-1 before the release of <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>6—if then. And Netscape Navigator 4, still used by tens of millions, does such a poor job of handling style sheets that it has been known to crash upon encountering them, as detailed in <em>A List Apart</em>’s "The Day the Browser Died."</p>
                <p>Faced with these inconsistencies, many web designers have avoided using <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> altogether. A few brave souls have leaped ahead to fully exploit the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in spite of the dangers posed to old browsers. Other web designers and developers have followed the "No-Fault <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>" plan outlined in <em>A List Apart</em>’s "Fear of Style Sheets" series, whether they picked it up at <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> or figured it out on their own.</p>
                <p>Still others—tricky devils—have created platform and browser detection scripts to serve a variety of "appropriate" style sheets to specific user agents—for instance, serving one style sheet to an <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>4/Mac user and another to a Navigator 4 user on Windows NT. This approach was always unpleasantly complicated, but at least it used to work. As we’ll show you in a moment, it no longer works.</p>
                <p>What works? Pixels or no sizing at all works. How can we make this audacious claim? We’ll let an expert make it for us. Take a sad look at Web Review’s Master List and see the inconsistencies for yourself:</p>
                <h6>The Master List</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102040214/http://www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml" title="Check out what webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml looked like back in 2001.">www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml</a></p>

                </div>
                <p>If the Master List did not convince you (or if you could not quite grasp its meaning), we’ll look at the alternatives one by one:</p>
                <h3>Font Size Challenges</h3>
                <p>Among many other capabilities, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allows web designers to specify the size of typography on web pages. As shown below, font sizes can be indicated using any of the following: points, pixels, absolute keywords, relative keywords, length units, and percentage units.</p>
                <p><code>H1 {font-size: 14pt}<br> 
                    H1 {font-size: 14px}<br> 
                    H1 {font-size: x-large}<br> 
                    H1 {font-size: larger}<br> 
                    H1 {font-size: 1.5 em}<br>
                    H1 {font-size: 125%}</code></p>
                <p>Too bad most of the stuff doesn’t work everywhere...yet.</p>
                <h4>Points of contention</h4>
                <p><em>Points</em> are the units of measure with which designers are most familiar—from their years of creating print layouts in Quark XPress or similar programs. Unfortunately, points are meaningless on the Web. Points function as units of print, not as units of screen space. (Pixels are the only meaningful unit of screen space.) Due to platform and resolution differences, 14<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. can mean many things. What it does not mean is a specific unit of screen size.</p>
                <p>Points are included in the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> spec so that designers can set up a second style sheet for printouts, as mentioned earlier in this chapter—one <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> document to control the way the display looks on the screen and a second for printing.</p>
                <p>In your print-oriented style sheet (if the browser supports this), it makes perfect sense to use points because printers understand points and can be thrown for a loop by pixels. In some older browsers, 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> type gets printed as 12 pixels, and those pixels are computed against the printer’s resolution. Got a 1200<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> printer? Your 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> type could be .01 inches tall. To avoid that kind of lunacy, points should be used in style sheets devoted to the printer—and nowhere else. (Better browsers recalculate style sheets according to the needs of the printer, but your visitors may not be using these browsers.)</p>
                <p>In the world of print, there are approximately 72 points per inch. To match this, Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> offers a default resolution of 72 pixels per inch, mapping pixels to points (give or take a fraction). Of course, as soon as the Mac user changes her screen resolution, all bets are off. In Windows and other <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> operating systems, there are 96 pixels per inch—until the <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> user changes her screen resolution, and then all bets are off.</p>
                <p>What this means is that point sizes are incompatible between Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> and Windows right from the get-go. For instance, when a Windows client sends a Microsoft Word document to a Mac-based graphic designer, the type is often too small for the designer to read. The same problem traditionally plagued web pages.</p>
                <p>Leaving aside the fact that most users change their screen resolution (and therefore all bets are off), savvy developers have used JavaScript to serve appropriate point-size-based style sheets to Mac users versus <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> users. It’s more complicated than using pixels, but at least it <em>used</em> to work.</p>
                <h4>Point of no return: browsers of the year 2000</h4>
                <p>In <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac and Netscape 6, this has changed. (See <em><abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr></em>’s "Why <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac Matters" for a complete discussion of this issue.)</p>
                <p><abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac sets as its default typographic preference 16<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> type at 96<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr>. In other words, it brings the default Windows typographic resolution to the desktop of Mac users. Netscape 6 does exactly the same thing.</p>
                <p>This is not evil hegemony; it is simply common sense in that the more closely browsers adhere to commonalities, the less likely web users are to get hurt. Windows’ default resolution is no better or worse than Mac resolution. But it is the most commonly used resolution, so more sites are designed to accommodate it. Treating it as a de facto "standard" prevents Mac users from being hurt by the poor authoring practices of some web developers.</p>
                <p>"Aha!" cries the Scripting Brigade. "So all we have to do is add a few more lines of code to our browser detection scripts, and we can serve Windows-size type to Mac users if they are surfing with <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 or Netscape 6 and Mac-size type if they are using older browsers?"</p>
                <p>Not so fast, buckos. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac starts at this default resolution but enables users to change it. They can change it back to standard Mac resolution (and how will you know if they’ve done that?). Adept users can change it to a size based specifically on their screen resolution, and Netscape 6 users can change their font size to any arbitrary value that strikes their fancy. You have no way of knowing if they’ve done this or not. Therefore, using JavaScript to detect the user’s browser and platform tells you exactly nothing about their default font size and its relationship to standard point sizes. There is only one thing of which we can be certain: If you use points to control sizes, you are kidding yourself.</p>
                <p>What works? Pixels.</p>
                <h4>Pixels for fun and profit</h4>
                <p>Though screen resolutions vary, a pixel is always equal to a pixel. Pixels are the only reliable means of sizing typography if the web designer absolutely must control the size of type on the web page. Unfortunately, this practice might cause problems for some readers. For instance, if the designer has specified 10-pixel type:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>The visually impaired might have difficulty reading the type. This is not a problem in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac, which allows users to resize type at their discretion by using the included "text zoom" function. Netscape 6 offers similar functionality, and Opera 5 zooms the entire page at the touch of a button. So in those browsers, you can use pixels without causing accessibility problems for anyone. (But these, as we’ve already explained, are not the most popular browsers.)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Older browsers do not allow visitors to resize most <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> type—particularly type set in pixels, and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5.5/Windows still does not offer text zooming at all. Thus, there will always be a potential accessibility hazard involved when you specify text in pixels—at least until <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> for Windows offers text zooming or an equivalent solution. As explained in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, we might have to wait 18 months or more for Netscape users to upgrade to the 6.0 browser and for Microsoft to implement text zoom in its Explorer browser for Windows.</span></li>
                    <li><span>If your stylesheet calls up a scalable TrueType font and if the user’s operating system includes that font (and supports True Type), your pixel-based style sheet will work just fine. But if the user’s system does not include a scalable version of that font or a suitable substitute or does not natively include True Type fonts (Linux for example), type set in pixels can display jaggedly and may be illegible.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Accessibility problems are deadly serious. This is not idle, theoretical chitchat. When people can’t read (or even access) your site, it hurts them, it hurts you, and it hurts your clients.</p>
                <p>Accessibility problems aside, some designers quibble that pixels are bad because they vary according to screen resolution. A 400 x 400 pixel square fills most of the screen at 640 x 480, and very little of it at 1600 x 1200.</p>
                <p>To which we reply, so what? A 100 pixel–tall <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> headline will be the same height as a 100 pixel–tall <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image. A 200 pixel–wide <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> div will be equivalent to a 200 pixel–wide <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> image.</p>
                <p>If you intend to create print-like layouts on the web—or even liquid layouts that depend on the relative sizing of elements—you have exactly one choice: pixels. If you can get away with a looser type of design (as you can, for instance, in a personal diary or an academic paper), so much the better. Most of us have to size the elements in our layouts, and most of us designers like it that way.</p>
                <p>Besides, our other options simply do not work. For instance:</p>
                <h4>Absolute size keywords</h4>
                <p>There are seven absolute size keywords in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Level 1:</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="orange">xx-small</span></td>
                        <td><span class="orange">medium</span></td>
                        <td><span class="orange">large</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="orange">x-small</span></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td><span class="orange">x-large</span></td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><span class="orange">small</span></td>
                        <td></td>
                        <td><span class="orange">xx-large</span></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>If implemented correctly and uniformly, these seven keywords would allow designers to specify approximate sizes without running into the accessibility problems associated with pixels. For that reason, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommends their use. The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is wise, and the recommendation is sound—except that it fails in too many browsers.</p>
                <h5>One size fits nobody</h5>
                <p>Unfortunately, absolute size keywords are unusable in many browsers. Netscape 4 largely ignores them. Netscape 4.5 and higher and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 render them at illegible sizes. (For instance, Netscape 4.5 and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 render xx-small at 6 pixels, which is 3 pixels below the threshold of legibility.) In Netscape’s case, the engineers were following an early recommendation of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>, which was that each size should be 1.5 times larger than the size below it. If small was 10 pixels, medium (one size larger) would be 15 pixels.</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> later changed its recommendation, but not before Netscape had followed it. We can’t fault Netscape for trying to support standards that changed, but we can point out the absurdity of using absolute size keywords if even one of your visitors is using Netscape 4 or <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3. And millions of folks use those browsers.</p>
                <h5>Small means medium, war means peace</h5>
                <p>Does <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5.x/Windows get it right? Not in our estimation. In <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5.x/Windows, there is a logical disconnection between the keyword and the way it is rendered. "Small" is displayed as medium; "medium" is larger than normal; and so on. (<abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>/Windows gets keywords right.)</p>
                <p>The engineers who developed <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> for Windows are not hacks and are not evil. They were trying to do the right thing. Remember the seven <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE></code> settings supported by Netscape? Sure you do—<code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE=1></code>, <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE=4></code>, and so on. Rather deftly and cleverly, the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> developers mapped the seven <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> keywords directly to the seven Netscape font sizes. In many ways, it was a logical and even brilliant thing to do. (The <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>/Windows developers were also the first group to attempt to support absolute font size keywords. We should credit them for that before carping about the results.)</p>
                <p>The problem, of course, is that, logically, the sizes do not map to the keywords. In old-style browsers, <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE=3></code> is the default or normal size that the user has specified in her preferences. In Netscape’s extended <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup, <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE=3></code> is assumed unless you specify another size. Logically, a default size should map to the "medium" <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> keyword. Unfortunately, in the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>/Windows scheme, <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT SIZE=3></code> maps to "small" instead of "medium" because small is the third size up from the bottom of the list.</p>
                <p>Who goofed—the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> or the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>/Windows team? It doesn’t really matter. What matters is that the keywords don’t map to expected sizes, and an incompatibility exists not only between different manufacturers’ browsers but between the Mac and Windows versions of the same browser.</p>
                <p>If you think of the seven sizes the way the <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>/Windows team did, your sizes will be off on Mac users’ desktops. (You also will go nuts. It’s like trying to drive a car where Park means Neutral.) If you think of them the way the keywords actually read (small, medium, large) your display will be off in Windows. You can trick the Mac browser into emulating Windows behavior by specifying a <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPE></code> of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4 Transitional and leaving off the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>. (For details, see <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010410202656/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/ie5mac" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/ie5mac looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/ie5mac</a>. But this is forcing the browser to emulate nonstandard behavior, and that's not good. Besides, it won't work in Netscape 4, Opera, or Konqueror.</p>
                <p>So what can you do? Sadly, until your entire audience uses browsers that render absolute keywords, all you can do is ignore the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommendations and use pixels in your style sheet. Or do not use sizes at all.</p>
                <h4>Relative keywords</h4>
                <p>Relative keywords are limited to two: smaller and larger. These in turn refer to the size of the parent element. For example, consider the following example, in which the <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> is 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr>, and <code class="nopad">&lt;BOLD></code> is "larger."</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;HTML><br>
                        &lt;STYLE TYPE="text/css"><br>
                        &lt;!--<br>
                        BODY {font: 12px verdana, arial, geneva;} B {font-weight: bold; font-size: larger;} --><br>
                        &lt;/STYLE>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Bold type would theoretically be 14<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> tall in this example because 14<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> is one "notch" up from 12<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr>. Like absolute size keywords, relative keywords are ignored or bungled in some popular browsers (Explorer 3 ignores them, as does Navigator 4 for the Mac). And even if they worked correctly, they would be insufficient for the needs of most web designers and their clients. Normal, larger, and smaller is not exactly a robust vocabulary for the needs of professional designers.</p>
                <p>So what can you do? You can use pixels in your style sheet; that’s what you can do.</p>
                <h4>Length units</h4>
                <p>Length units sound smutty (those <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> folks should get out more...or maybe it’s just us) and include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><strong>em</strong>—Is a unit of distance equal to the point size of a font. In 14<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. type, an em is 14<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>s. wide—named for the size of the capital "M." But you knew that.)</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>ex</strong>—Refers to the height of lowercase letters.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>When used with the font-size property, em and ex units refer to the font size of the parent element.</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;HTML><br>
                        &lt;STYLE TYPE="text/css"><br>
                        &lt;!--<br>
                        BODY {font: 12px verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif;} STRONG {font-weight: bold; font-size: 2em;}<br>
                        --><br>
                        &lt;/STYLE>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>In this example, <code class="nopad">&lt;STRONG></code> would be 24<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> tall, or 2em (two times the font size of the parent element, which is the <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> tag). In theory, a web designer could create a layout using em or ex units, where all elements were sized relative to each other. This would avoid the accessibility problems associated with pixels.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the browsers make this impossible for the time being. Netscape 4 ignores em and ex units. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 treats em units as pixels. Thus, 2em is mistranslated as 2 pixels tall. It takes a village to raise a child, and it takes at least 9 pixels to render a font. Length units are therefore not recommended. What is recommended? Pixels or nothing.</p>
                <h4>Percentage units</h4>
                <p>Percentage units, like length units and relative keywords, refer to the size of the parent element.</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;HTML><br>
                        &lt;STYLE TYPE="text/css"><br>
                        &lt;!--<br>
                        BODY {font: 12px verdana, arial, geneva, sans-serif;} STRONG {font-weight: bold; font-size: 200%;}<br>
                        --><br>
                        &lt;/STYLE>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>In this example, <code class="nopad">&lt;STRONG></code> would be 24<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> tall, or 200% of the font size of the parent element, which is the <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> tag. In theory (notice how we keep saying "in theory"?), a web designer could create a layout using percentages and avoid the accessibility problems associated with pixels.</p>
                <p>Nothing is sadder than the murder of a beautiful theory by a gang of ugly facts. Netscape 4 for Mac renders percentage units when they are used for line-height (leading) but ignores them entirely when they are used to specify type sizes. And some versions of Netscape 4 for Windows treat percentages as pixels. (Thus, 200% is dementedly translated as 200 pixels. Mmm, nice layout.)</p>
                <p>Lest we forget, good old <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 drops the ball by sizing percentages relative to the user’s default font size rather than to the parent element. In English: If the web user has set her browser’s default to 10<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr>, <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 will display <code class="nopad">&lt;STRONG></code> at 20<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> and not the 24<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> you intended. If her browser defaults to 16<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr>, <code class="nopad">&lt;STRONG></code> will be 32<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr>. Too bad for you. Too bad for your visitor.</p>
                <p>In spite of their accessibility benefits, percentages still fail in too many browsers. What works? Pixels—pixels or nothing. In case we’ve failed to communicate, we will summarize our findings as follows:</p>
                <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                <p>Web designers will continue to be limited to using pixels in their style sheets—despite the accessibility hazards associated with that practice—until fully standards-compliant browsers exist and are widely used. The approach might have its drawbacks, but failure to work correctly is not one of them. As web designers, our job is to control the visitor’s visual experience to communicate. For the time being, the approach outlined here will allow us to do exactly that. And soon enough, Lord (and browser companies) willing, the full power of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> will be ours.</p>
                <p>Can you take <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> further today? Quite possibly. It depends on the makeup of your audience and your salesmanship with clients. As explained in <a href="13.html" title="Check out chapter 13.">Chapter 13</a>, A List Apart converted to an all-<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> layout in February 2001, and many sites have since followed suit.
