                <h1>Beyond Text/Pictures</h1>
                <p>ON FIRST DISCOVERING THAT THE WEB IS NOT PRINT, many designers see only the drawbacks: poor typographic resolution; a limited pool of installed user fonts; bandwidth bugaboos; the need to compensate for browser, platform, and hardware differences; and the awkwardness of trying to read a computer screen in the bathroom.</p>
                <p>As we start to become genuine web designers, though, most of us see more advantages than disadvantages in the Web’s distinctive differences from print. For example, instant worldwide distribution looks pretty darned good after wrestling with print shops and mail houses.</p>
                <p>The longer we work at it, the more we marvel at the Web’s ability to provide universal access across seemingly unbridgeable gaps of technology, nationality, economic and political systems, and physical ability or disability.</p>
                <p>As these barriers are crossed, the human spirit becomes less isolated, suspicion and intolerance begin to fade, and we learn to appreciate each other’s differences instead of fearing them. These benefits will greatly increase if the whole world gets to come along for the ride. They will greatly diminish if too many humans get left behind.</p>
                <p>This, the substance of the vision of the founders of the Web, should be enough. But there is more. In particular, there are the two profound differences between the Web and print that we’ll discuss in this chapter:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>The ability to develop not simply static pages, but full-fledged, <span class="orange">dynamic experiences</span></li>
                    <li><span>The visual, sonic, and interactive possibilities inherent in <span class="orange">rich media</span>, whether it is delivered through emerging web standards or popular plug-in technologies</span></li>
                </ol> 
                <p>These two unique strengths of the Web have tremendous implications for business and for art. Each has played a huge part in popularizing the medium. Each brims with powerful potential that designers and developers have barely begun to tap. Each also has the potential to be abused.</p>

                <h2 class="clearfix">Prelude to the Afternoon of Dynamic Websites</h2>
                <p>In <a href="11.html" title="Check out chapter 11.">Chapter 11</a>, "The Joy of JavaScript," we saw how JavaScript and its big brother, the Document Object Model (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>), facilitate interactivity that printed media can only dream about. In the pages that follow, we’ll look at additional and powerful ways of making the Web more interactive.</p>
                <p>Dynamic sites enable web users to locate information, store phone numbers in a shared contact database, buy holiday gifts without braving crowded shopping centers, or view "adult" material without shame until the baby-sitter barges in.</p>
                <p>In this chapter, we will see how web agencies use server-side applications to build sites that let users do things. We’ll look at where the web designer fits in and how server-side applications help us manage immense content sites or change text and appearance in response to user actions. We’ll also discuss how small shops and freelancers can get in on the action even if they don’t have casts of thousands and budgets of millions at their disposal.</p>
                <p>We’ll also see how technologies like Java can compensate for "missing pieces" in our visitors’ browser setups or unleash full-fledged software programs that run right in the browser. And we’ll explore Java’s potential beyond the desktop.</p>

                <h3 class="clearfix">You Can Never Be Too Rich Media</h3>
                <p>After all that, we’ll examine emerging "multimedia" web standards that are almost ready for prime time and take a peek and a poke at plug-in technologies that can radically enhance your sites—if used with respect for the realities of average web users.</p>
                <p>These technologies are not for every site, but, when appropriate, they can enhance the web user’s experience tremendously. Used poorly, of course, they lead to less satisfying experiences. We will explore all these technologies and consider what causes both kinds of experiences.</p>
                <p>Knowing you as we do, we’ll start with the drier, more technical stuff because if we saved it for later, you’d never read it.</p>
                <h2>The Form of Function: Dynamic Technologies</h2>
                <p>Think back to our earlier discussion of Perl versus JavaScript in <a href="2.html" title="Check out Chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, "Designing for the Medium." As far as the Web is concerned, Perl is most often used in <em>server-side</em> transactions, such as the processing of a visitor-submitted mail form. You might remember that a server-side technology is one in which the computing process takes place on the web <em>server</em> (hence the name) rather than the end-user’s <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>. With Perl, number-crunching tasks fall to the web server, while the visitor’s computer sits idly, waiting.</p>
                <p>We contrasted Perl with JavaScript, whose actions take place in the browser. With JavaScript, the end-user’s computer (the "client," in geek parlance) does the heavy lifting. JavaScript is a <em>client-side</em> technology. Naturally, the dynamic technologies we’re about to consider do some work on the client side and some on the server side. After all, the two sides are continually interacting. If the two sides, client and server, were <em>not</em> continually interacting, you would not have web transactions; you would just have machines sitting around doing nothing, like Teamsters.</p>
                <p>But though they necessarily move from one realm to the other, most of the dynamic technologies we’re about to discuss do the bulk of their work either on the server or on the user’s desktop. Sometimes <em>where</em> they work is so important it becomes part of their name. For instance, as you might guess, Server Side Includes (<abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>) is a server-side technology. Mostly, though, the names of web technologies give very little away. For instance, would you guess, from its name alone, that <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> (originally called Personal Home Page tools) is a server-side technology? Probably not.</p>
                <p>Some versatile technologies work both sides of the street. Java, for instance, is frequently used on the client side, as a downloadable applet. But it also performs many server-side jobs. You’ll hear developers and systems administrators talk about Java <em>servlets</em>, which are miniature Java applications that run the Apache server’s <code class="nopad">mod_jserv</code> component. Or you might host a site on Jigsaw, a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> server that’s written entirely in the Java language.</p>
                <p>You don’t really have to know any of this, as long as you get the general idea. Now let’s move on to some specifics.</p>
                <h3>Server-Side Stuff</h3>
                <p>The days of slicing Photoshop comps and hand-coding every last <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page are not dead—they just smell bad.</p>
                <p>One day soon, web designers will be fully liberated from these crude production methods. It will happen when a core group of web standards is completely supported in browsers, enabling us to separate style from content, presentation from structure, and design from data. It hasn’t happened yet, as any working web designer can tell you. It’s coming soon, we tell you now. We’ll talk more about it in <a href="13.html" title="Check out Chapter 13.">Chapter 13</a>, "Never Can Say Goodbye," so save your questions until then.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, we have interim solutions that let us create web pages without, well, creating web pages. Under the principles of dynamic site construction, we can establish the <em>conditions</em> for web pages instead of building each page individually.</p>
                <p>The process is simple: To begin with, web designers create visual templates, while writers, editors, and marketers create content. (Hopefully the two teams are talking to each other so that design and content work together.) The content is stored and indexed in vast, humming "back-end" databases, and the site is launched. When visitors request data, server-side <em>middle-ware applications</em> fetch the appropriate content and pour it into the designer’s template. The result: virtual pages that can be read, used, and bookmarked but that do not exist as conventional, self-contained <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents. Oh, oh, oh, it’s magic. Let’s descend to earth and see how it works.</p>
                <h4>Where were you in ‘82?</h4>
                <p>Ever used a search engine such as Google (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182144/http://www.google.com" title="Check out what google.com looked like back in 2001.">www.google.com</a>)? You type in the name of your former high school sweetheart and hit the Google Search button. Moments later, you’re presented with page after page of links.</p>
                <p>From these pages you learn that your old flame is the two-term governor of a large Midwestern state, honorary dean of a prestigious university, has had two charities, a hospital wing, and a Ben & Jerry’s flavor named after her, and relaxes by participating in amateur kick-boxing tournaments.</p>
                <p>The question, of course, is why did you ever break up with her? But for our purposes, the question is, where do these Google results pages come from?</p>
                <p>The Google results pages are created on the fly by software that sucks query-related entries from a huge database, determines which links are probably most relevant, and pours the results into a preexisting <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> template.</p>
                <p>Who made the software? Programmers. How does data get into the database? More software: specifically, a search engine <em>spider</em>, so named because it crawls around the Web indexing the content and location of individual web pages. Where does the designer fit in? The designer creates the template that the software uses to display the results. How does the designer do that? Let’s see.</p>
                <h4>Indiana Jones and the template of doom</h4>
                <p>As a web designer, you might be called upon to design the front end of an application like Google, or you might work on vast content sites that rely on similarly dynamic processing. Or you could design a site that sells things, revealing new products in response to the visitor’s desires.</p>
                <p>Paradoxically, <em>your</em> job will not change that much from what we’ve described earlier in this book. You are still creating the part of the site that the visitor sees. You design it as you would any other web project. In a way, it’s like designing a magazine’s table of contents page. You create the master design; someone else designs the individual issues. It’s also like designing corporate letterhead in that your responsibility ends when you deliver the approved letterhead design. You don’t have to sit and type individual business letters. Creating website templates is as normal as those more familiar design processes. It’s after the image pieces and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> templates leave your desk that the voodoo kicks in.</p>
                <p>Precisely what happens next is up to your team’s developers—those who write the scripts that make these dynamic transactions possible. The developers take <em>their</em> lead from information architects, whose job is to figure out "user flow" through the transactional portions of the site. (Who will come here? What will they want to do? How can we best fulfill their needs? What can go wrong?) The very things we advised you to do when planning an entire site, information architects do as they envision and structure the site’s transactions.</p>
                <p>The data can be stored in an open source MySQL database, or in similar programs from Microsoft, Oracle, and other companies. As each visitor hits the site and begins to take actions, the middleware that lies between the visitor and the back-end database begins to do its thing.</p>
                <p>It is the job of the middleware to process each request, fetch the appropriate document (or document fragment), and pour it into your template. Common middleware applications include open source <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, Allaire Cold Fusion, and Microsoft Active Server Pages (<abbr title="Active Server Pages">ASP</abbr>). MySQL is often found on UNIX Apache servers, Microsoft SQL and <abbr title="Active Server Pages">ASP</abbr> on Microsoft Windows NT servers, and <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> can run on UNIX Apache or Windows/IIS.</p>
                <p>Deciding on the appropriate database and middleware is not your concern. Technology officers and network administrators solve that problem. You aren’t expected to write code that complies with these middleware programs’ requirements either; developers do that, and we love them for it. You <em>can</em> learn to write code for <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, <abbr title="Active Server Pages">ASP</abbr>, or Cold Fusion if you wish, and we’ll have something to say about that in the "Doing More," section that follows.</p>
                <p>Ordinarily, the developers and project managers will provide you with guidelines in a document that might be called the <em>functional</em> spec. They will also discuss requirements with you in one or more personal meetings—probably more. "We can’t have frames," they might tell you or, "we must have frames," could be their direction. Don’t skip these meetings and don’t rush to argue. Talk, listen, and learn.</p>
                <p>The work process is but a variation on what you already do. You might take the comp no further than Photoshop; the developers will try to emulate it in, say, Cold Fusion, and show you the result. You might ask them to revise their code to bring the design up to your spec; they might ask you to revisit the design to accommodate limitations in the software or particular site requirements.</p>
                <p>You will also write the Cascading Style Sheet (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) that determines colors, type sizes, margins, leading, and so on—same as always. You might find that some of these middleware technologies are unfortunately ill-suited to <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and you might need to do some <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> table work or have it done by your friendly neighborhood web technician.</p>
                <p>It is sad but not surprising that some of these dynamic tools (Cold Fusion and the like) are more suited to old-style methods of web construction (<code class="nopad">&lt;FONT></code> tags, table-based layouts, and so on) than to the newer, standards-based methods (structural markup, design via <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>). After all, these server-side tools arose in a market driven by browser quirks and proprietary technologies, not by universally supported web standards. As browsers improve their support for web standards and as web designers and developers begin using these standards instead of whining about them or pleading ignorance, the dynamic tools will likely improve in this regard.</p>
                <h4>Serving the project</h4>
                <p>As you might expect, database-driven sites, built with templates, are usually not the place to show off your deep Photoshop layering skills, your ability to bring complex layouts to life via frames, or your newly acquired mastery of <em><abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr></em>. Low bandwidth, large areas of flat, web-safe color, reasonably sized web fonts: This is the terrain you must plow; these are the fields you must harvest.</p>
                <p>Some web designers understand this as part of the discipline of the craft and strive to bring beauty, elegance, and utility to their simple designs. Others rebel and might be temperamentally unsuited to this type of work. The Web needs both kinds of designers, and there is plenty of work for both.</p>
                <p>The need for simplicity is another reason that it’s best to do as much of the design work as possible in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (as long as the middleware doesn’t choke on it). There is little sense in asking the server to generate deeply nested table cells when you can achieve the same result with light, clean, structural markup and a single declaration in a global style sheet. By doing the work in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, you save processor cycles and bandwidth; and when it comes time to update the design, you can do it yourself in the style sheet instead of pestering the programmers to change their scripts.</p>
                <p>Naturally, you will have to test to make sure that the middleware your company has chosen can handle the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> you’ve written. You’ll also have to test the site in multiple browsers, as described in <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, "Riding the Project Life Cycle." During testing, you also will want to turn off <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in your browsers to make sure that the resulting pages work in non-<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> browsers (or in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> browsers whose users have turned off <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> in their preferences).</p>
                <p>What do we mean by "make sure the pages work with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> turned off?" We mean that the pages work. We don’t mean that the pages look the same with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and without it. Bad clients and stupid companies expect sites to look exactly the same in <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr> 1.0 and Netscape 6. That’s impossible without quadrupling the budget, and it’s also pointless. Those who turn off <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> or use older browsers aren’t hoping for a rich visual experience. If you stick with basic structural markup and the simple <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> techniques described in <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>, "Style Sheets for Designers," you should be fine.</p>
                <h2>Doing More</h2>
                <p>Coding in <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> or <abbr title="Active Server Pages">ASP</abbr> rarely falls within the web designer’s job description, but after working in the field for a while, many web designers are pleased to discover that they have a knack for these simple programming environments. If you are one of them, this knack will not go unappreciated or make you any less marketable.</p>
                <h3>Mini-Case Study: Waferbaby.com</h3>
                <p>Waferbaby (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191037/http://www.waferbaby.com" title="Check out what waferbaby.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.waferbaby.com/</a>), Daniel Bogan’s delightful, personal site, makes smart use of <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> to facilitate dynamic content such as the site’s "Brainstorm" section and to enable playfully user-centric design, as seen in the site’s "Preferences" department (see Figure 12.3).</p>

                        <p>User-selectable "Preferences" at Daniel Bogan’s Waferbaby. Choose a look, and the site changes. Though this might appear to be the brainchild of a programmer, Bogan is actually an animator-illustrator. If he can do it, you can do it (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191037/http://www.waferbaby.com" title="Check out what waferbaby.com looked like back in 2000.">http://www.waferbaby.co<wbr>m/</a>).</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">In "Brainstorm," readers respond to a provocative question on the site by typing their answers in a form. Instantly, these answers appear on the page, in reverse chronological order. Readers vie to outdo the wit and originality of previous answers. The audience creates the content; personal involvement and natural curiosity promote repeat visits.</p>
                <p>In "Preferences," visitors can modify Waferbaby’s appearance by choosing alternate color schemes and typographic choices modeled after well-known personal sites or create their own look and feel by editing a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> document right in the browser. When the reader is happy with the color scheme and typography, it is stored as a JavaScript cookie on her hard drive. The site will use her chosen color scheme and fonts until she decides to change it.</p>
                <p>Both "Brainstorm" and "Preferences" are made possible by a few lines of code in <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, a JavaScript cookie, and a MySQL database to store and fetch the results.</p>
                <h3>Mini-Case Study: Metafilter.com</h3>
                <p>In 1999, Matt Haughey used Allaire Cold Fusion to create Metafilter (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182340/http://www.metafilter.com" title="Check out what metafilter.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.metafilter.com/</a>), a community site for web authors who like to write about other people’s web content. This site will be discussed again in <a href="13.html" title="Check out chapter 13.">Chapter 13</a>. For the time being, it is worth noting how Metafilter accommodates two levels of dynamic change: instantaneous change based on user actions and evolutionary change based on user patterns observed over time (see Figure 12.4).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="12.4.png" alt="Figure 12.4" class="large-6 columns">

                        <p>Matt Haughey’s Metafilter community site, a web-based application that responds to its members’ needs. The dark blue panel at right, introduced in January 2001, keeps members posted on changes in the way the site functions (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182340/http://www.metafilter.com" title="Check out what metafilter.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.metafilter.co<wbr>m/</a>).</p></figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">As in Waferbaby’s "Brainstorm," at Metafilter, user participation fashions the content, generating loyalty and repeat usage. As usage patterns emerge, Haughey responds to them by adjusting the way the site works. A new feature is added, an old one removed. This in turn changes the way the site is perceived and used. New usage patterns emerge, and over time, new site-wide changes are instituted.</p>
                <p>Every site owner studies usage patterns and changes the site accordingly: rotating content more frequently in the most visited sections; clarifying a text label if one section of the site continually goes ignored; changing the design to emphasize the least-visited section (or the most-visited); or removing front page links to sections the public simply seems not to care about (but keeping those sections alive to avoid link rot). The possibilities are many.</p>
                <p>Add dynamic, user-generated content to the mix, and the potential grows even more interesting. On top of everything else, a psychological dynamic begins to emerge. Is the community shaping the site, or is the site shaping the community?</p>
                <p>We don’t wish to imply that this whole thing goes on like a scientific experiment or that the community in question serves as some kind of Petri dish slide. As in any good community site, the owner/moderator is as involved as any other member—but with the added ability to institute changes or solicit suggested changes from the members. What is interesting is the way that human dynamic behavior shapes <em>and is shaped</em> by basic web dynamism. This is the power of a site that changes when you type on it.</p>
                <p>This is interactivity print cannot match.</p>
                <h3>Any Size Kid Can Play</h3>
                <p>We’ve confined our case studies to two relatively small-scale (but influential) projects to show that dynamic interactivity is within the reach of even the modest web shop or the lone freelancer. Large-scale projects require teams of information architects, project managers, web designers, developers, writers, web technicians, producers, network administrators, server consultants, marketers, advertising teams, editors, and content specialists. If you go into full-time web design, you will likely be part of such enterprises. But even sites created by tiny teams can use the techniques just discussed to add web dynamism to the mix.</p>
                <p>For instance, a dyed-in-the-wool print designer wishes to service a few of his clients who’ve requested smallish websites: 10 to 20 pages of mostly static content. One of these clients urgently desires the ability to post customer feedback onsite in real time. Initially that seems beyond the reach of the print designer-cum-web designer, but a few hours with a book on <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> will change all that. The client gets his interactivity; the designer gets a higher fee. Hopefully the consumer is also better served.</p>
                <p>You might think all this is "too technical" for you. If you don’t believe you will ever be able to wrap your head around server-side stuff, let us now introduce you to Server Side Includes (<abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>), the technology we mentioned earlier in this chapter.</p>
                <h2>Take a Walk on the Server Side</h2>
                <p>As a working web designer, you might find yourself cutting and pasting the same menu bar into page after <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page. For instance, you might have cut and pasted something like this into all 500 pages of your site:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!--Begin menu --><br>
                        &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><br>
                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;tr valign="top"></span><br>
                        <span class="doubleextraleft">&lt;td width="20%" valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#cccc00" height="25"></span><br>
                        <span class="tripleextraleft">&lt;a href="/main.html" onmouseover="window.status=’Current issue. You\’re soaking in it.’; return true;" onmouseout="window.status=’’; return true;"></span><br>

                        <span class="tripleextraleft">&lt;a href="/stories/" onmouseover="window.status=’Past issues.’; changeImages(‘stories’, ‘/menu3/stories_o.gif’); return true;" onmouseout="window.status=’’; changeImages(‘stories’, ‘/menu3/stories.gif’); return true;"></span><br>
                        &lt;img name="stories" src="/menu3/stories.gif" valign="top" align="left" height="25" border="0" alt="Past issues.">&lt;/a>&lt;/td><br>
                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;/tr></span><br>
                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;tr></span><br>
                        <span class="doubleextraleft">&lt;td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#cccc00" height="25"></span><br> 
                        <span class="tripleextraleft">&lt;a href="/news.html" onmouseover="window.status=’Site news.’; changeImages(‘news’, ‘/menu3/news_o.gif’); return true;" onmouseout="window.status=’’; changeImages(‘news’, ‘/menu3/news.gif’); return true;"></span><br>

                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;/tr></span><br> 
                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;tr></span><br>
                        <span class="doubleextraleft">&lt;td valign="top" align="left" bgcolor="#cccc00" height="25"></span><br> 
                        <span class="tripleextraleft">&lt;a href="/join.html" onmouseover="window.status=’Our mailing list.’; changeImages(‘list’, ‘/menu3/list_o.gif’); return true;" onmouseout="window.status=’’; changeImages(‘list’, ‘/menu3/list.gif’); return true;"></span><br>
                        &lt;img name="list" src="/menu3/list.gif" valign="top" align="left" height="25" border="0" alt="Our mailing list.">&lt;/a>&lt;/td><br>
                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;/tr></span><br>
                        &lt;/table><br>
                        &lt;!-- End menu -->
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Ugly, isn’t it? What if you could replace that entire chunk of repugnance with one comely line of code? Namely:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;!-- #include virtual="/includes/menu.inc" --></code></p>
                <p>You can do it!</p>
                <p>To do it, let’s assume that the menu mess was part of a page called <span class="orange">index.html</span>.</p>
                <p>First, cut the menu mess out of <span class="orange">index.html</span>, paste it into a blank document, and save that document as <span class="orange">menu.inc</span>. The <span class="orange">.inc</span> stands for "include," though technically speaking, includes can have any file extension—even <span class="orange">.html</span>. Your systems administrator will tell you if includes require a particular or unusual file extension.</p>
                <p>Now in <span class="orange">index.html</span>, where the menu mess used to be, type that one line:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;!-- #include virtual="/includes/menu.inc" --></code></p>
                <p>What do these tags mean? <span class="orange">&lt;!--</span> is a null tag containing a comment; <span class="orange">&lt;!-- #include --></span> is an include; <span class="orange">virtual</span> means that what follows in quotes is a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> pointing to the file you wish to include; and <span class="orange">--></span> closes the comment and the include.</p>
                <p>Next, you’ll save <span class="orange">menu.inc</span> in an "includes" directory on your web server. You don’t <em>have</em> to save it in such a directory, but it makes sense, just as it makes sense to save <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s in a "gifs" directory, QuickTime movies in a "quicktime" or "movies" directory, and so on. As described in <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, this makes it easier to find pieces and write appropriate file references during the site’s creation and subsequent maintenance. If for some reason you prefer to save your <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> files in a directory called "rosebud," the reference would read:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;!-- #include virtual="/rosebud/menu.inc" --></code></p>
                <p>Now simply use that line of code in every <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document where you formerly had to cut and paste a heap of menu bar markup. Then upload your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages to the web server.</p>
                <p>Some folks use a different file extension, such as <span class="orange">.shtml</span> or <span class="orange">.shtm</span>, if their <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file contains an include, and some servers require this. But if you can stick to the <span class="orange">.html</span> file extension, you’ll avoid confusion and heartache down the road.</p>
                <p>Why confusion and heartache? We knew you were going to ask. For one thing, imagine that your static <span class="orange">.html</span> pages have been bookmarked by visitors and search engines. You then start changing your file extensions. All of a sudden, your internal and external links are broken, your visitors are confused, and the search engines that ranked you so highly are pointing to nonexistent pages.</p>
                <h3>Are You Being Served?</h3>
                <p>You’ve replaced redundant markup with neat, clean includes. What’s the next step? There probably isn’t one. Most web servers natively support <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>s. If it doesn’t work right away, you might need to contact the company hosting your site (or the network administrator if your company hosts its own sites) and ask that the configuration file be changed to permit <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>s. Unless the hosting company hires trained monkeys as tech support, complying with your request will take two minutes.</p>
                <p>Of course, if you are sane, you will have made this phone call before changing all your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages. Or you will have created a test <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page, uploaded it, and confirmed with your own eyes and mouse cursor that it works.</p>
                <p>More than one <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> can be put to use on each page. You can replace the "header," the "footer," or just about any piece of the puzzle. Using <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>, you can replace all or nearly all of the dull, repetitive junk that holds web pages together.</p>
                <p>In turn, you can begin viewing <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> pages <em>as content containers</em> rather than tortuous masterpieces of visually oriented markup—because <em>content containers</em> are exactly what they are and were always intended to be. This might not be the true separation of style from content, but it will do until the real thing comes along.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> can do many things besides what we’ve outlined here. It can insert appropriate text, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> based on the user’s browser. It can indicate when the page was last updated (<code class="nopad">&lt;!--#echo var="LAST_MODIFIED" --></code>), give the current date and time, and do other funky tricks.</p>
                <p>And, as we’ve said, <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> is the low end. Imagine the possibilities if you begin to work with more advanced server-side technologies.</p>
                <h3>Advantages of <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr></h3>
                <p>If a site changes—or perhaps we should say <em>when</em> a site changes (for instance, when a new section must be added to the menu bar)—the power of <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> is revealed. What was true for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is just as true for <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>: It is easier to edit a single document (<span class="orange">menu.inc</span>) than it is to change hundreds or thousands.</p>
                <p>Hopefully, your client is not about to wantonly add new sections to the menu or demand changes to the appearance of the menu after the site is nearly built. In a perfect world, you have followed the suggestions in <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, and the client has signed off (and paid part of your fee) at each stage of completion. Therefore, the client has a vested interest in following through with the plan he committed to and paid for and has no vested interest in pulling last-minute changes to prove that he is the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>inant monkey in this rainforest.</p>
                <p>But clients are clients, and change happens. <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> is a simple way of protecting yourself from hours of tedious replacement tasks.</p>
                <h3>Disadvantages of <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr></h3>
                <p>Being a server-side technology, <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> eats up processing power from the server. Every time a visitor hits a page containing a replaced <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr> element, the markup describing that element must be fetched from the server—like a stick in the jaws of a panting mastiff.</p>
                <p>If you’re building a professionally hosted site with plenty of server power in reserve, such demands on the server are no problem. If you’re hosting the site on your home computer and connected to your home cable modem, there could be a problem. Given sufficient traffic, the toll on your <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> might be noticeable, and the site might "slow down" for your visitors during times of peak traffic. On the other hand, if you’re hosting an extremely popular site on your home computer, maybe it’s time to upgrade your server.</p>
                <p>If you are interested in server-side technologies, Jeff Veen’s <em>The Art & Science of Web Design</em> (New Riders: 2001) discusses the subject in more detail—and using better words and stuff. If you are uninterested in server-side technologies to the point of anxiety, you’ll be happy to know that we’ve finished discussing them.</p>
                <p>Now let’s look at a technology you will frequently encounter in your career but will never even contemplate programming yourself. Let’s talk about Java. First of all, what the heck is it?</p>
                <h2>Cookin’ with Java</h2>
                <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012190415/http://www.sun.com" title="Check out what sun.com looked like back in 2000.">http://www.sun.com/</a>) primarily for the Web. And just what, you ask, is an object-oriented programming language? An object-oriented language is one that reuses software objects the same way you might reuse custom shapes you’d created in Adobe Illustrator or a sales executive might reuse chunks of boilerplate text about "tremendous synergies, should our two companies work together."</p>
                <p>In Illustrator, you can recombine basic button shapes, spirals, or complex outlines to create new artwork from predesigned fragments. Similarly, a Java programmer can combine entire libraries worth of coded objects to build new programs from existing parts. Reusing graphic elements makes you faster and more productive; reusing code objects does the same thing for Java programmers.</p>
                <p>Reusable parts: that’s the idea. Sun’s programmers called these parts <em>objects</em>. Sun didn’t invent this idea. Windows, Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, and UNIX also reuse code objects (Windows DLLs, anyone?). But in operating systems like Windows, Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, and UNIX, these reusable parts are immediately compiled down to machine code. In Java, they are compiled to an intermediary format called "bytecode," which is then interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine, about which we’ll have more to say in just a moment.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier in this chapter, Java can be used to create full-scale programs (applications), miniature programs that download quickly when needed (applets), or server-side <em>servlets</em>. Servlets are full-fledged but small application fragments that run in the context of the server—as Photoshop plug-ins run in the context of Photoshop.</p>
                <h3>Ghost in the Virtual Machine</h3>
                <p>But there’s a catch. Just as Windows programs require a Windows environment and Mac programs are designed for Macs, Java programs must run in a Java environment.</p>
                <p>Does this mean that you have to go out and buy a Java computer? No, it simply means that Java programs are designed to run in Java-capable web browsers (Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer), Java-capable web-enabled devices, or special Java devices (such as Java-powered digital television-top boxes and remotes). They do this by means of Java Virtual Machines, which we promise, really truly promise, we will describe in just a moment.</p>
                <p>Netscape was the first browser to support Java, and the point of the Sun/Netscape partnership, as explained in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, was to smash Windows hegemony while getting Java onto as many platforms as possible, by way of the browser. They succeeded at getting Java onto as many platforms as possible. One out of two ain’t bad.</p>
                <p>Today most browsers and computer operating systems support Java. It gets a bit more complicated when the browser or <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> maker offers an "improved" Java environment that Sun does not consider truly Java-compatible, but we’ll get to that later. Java-capable browsers might run on any computing platform (Windows, Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, Linux, UNIX, or Be<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>) as long as the browser manufacturer supports that platform.</p>
                <p>What makes all of this work? The Java Virtual Machine does. You might think of the Virtual Machine as a streamlined computer operating system (<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>) running inside another computer <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>—a Java computer running inside Windows, for example. Or you might think of it as an interpreter, turning spoken words into sign language for the hearing-impaired.</p>
                <p>This Virtual Machine is sometimes included with the browser. Early versions of Netscape included a Virtual Machine customized for each <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. This added significantly to the download time but ensured that users would have the then-new Java technology at their disposal.</p>
                <p>In other cases, the Virtual Machine is built into the operating system. For instance, Apple Macintosh <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>9 includes "Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> Runtime for Java," a Java Virtual Machine whose sole purpose is to run Java programs on the Mac.</p>
                <p>If you install <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 Macintosh Edition on a pre-<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> 9 Mac, you might get Java errors because <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac expects a more recent Virtual Machine than the one on your system. You can correct this problem by upgrading to <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>9 or by downloading a more recent version of Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> Runtime for Java from <a href="//developer.apple.com/search/index.php?q=java" title="Check out what developer.apple.com/java/classic.html looked like back in 2000.">http://developer.apple.com/java/classic.html</a>. The program is free.</p>
                <p>As you can see, the tantalizing potential of Java lies in its ability to work in any operating system equipped with a Java Virtual machine—in other words, theoretically at least, to run on any operating system. Practically speaking, developers could build a word processor or a full-blown office suite that runs in any Java-capable web browser and on any operating system with a Virtual Machine. Of course, companies that make word processors and full-blown office suites might not like that idea. They might dislike it so much that they would end up building their own web browser and taking over the market...not that we’re mentioning any names. There is, in fact, a Java word processor (indeed, there is an entire Java office suite), and we hear it works quite well.</p>
                <h4>Where the web designer fits in</h4>
                <p>As a web designer, you might be called upon to embed a Java applet in an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page. (Again: An applet is a self-contained piece of code that runs within a Java-capable browser, as Photoshop plug-ins run within Photoshop.) This is simply a matter of using the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code class="nopad">&lt;OBJECT></code> or <code class="nopad">&lt;APPLET></code> tag or another very basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag—no problem at all. At other times, you might use Java to compensate for a missing plug-in on a visitor’s system.</p>
                <p>For instance, the IpixViewer plug-in, like Apple’s QuickTime <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> (see the section, "Turn on, Tune in, Plug-in" later in this chapter), enables visitors to explore 360o panoramic views of any location that can be photographed. It’s an extraordinary plug-in that does a remarkable job. But not many people know about this plug-in, so not many have downloaded it. Therefore you might feel that IpixViewer content cannot be used on your site. Not to worry! The missing plug-in can be replaced by a Java applet and compiled down to native, platform-specific code via the Java Virtual Machine:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;applet name="IpixViewer" code="IpixViewer.class" archive="IpixViewer.jar" height="210" width="280"><br>
                        &lt;param name="URL" value="zabptcaj.ipx"><br>
                        &lt;param name="Spin" value="on"><br>
                        &lt;/applet>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>If the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> just listed looks odd to you, don’t sweat it. Your Java developer will tell you what needs to be included on the page. Your job will be to insert it, test it, and verify things such as height and width. (Is the resulting image in fact 210 pixels high? Does it look right? If not, change the numbers and try again.) By the way, this same technique works for other multimedia content, such as Flash. If the visitor lacks the Flash plug-in, a Java applet can display the Flash content. Your developers will create the applet and the complex code that determines whether or not the applet is needed on each visitor’s system. Your job is simply to plug in some <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and test.</p>
                <p>The other reason you need to know about Java is that in spite of its utopian aims and utilitarian benefits, Java can sometimes be problematic. And as a <em>user-oriented</em> web designer, you need to be aware of that.</p>
                <h3>Java Woes</h3>
                <p>We can do this two ways: the short, brutal version or the long, boring, politically correct version.</p>
                <p>Here’s the short, brutal version: From a user experience perspective, Java often sucks. It can be as unstable as Norman Bates, drain resources like Australians drain beer steins, and crash more frequently than a drunk driver’s Pinto.</p>
                <p>For those who expect us to be fair, a long, carefully guarded, politically correct version follows. Feel free to skip it unless you are an attorney for Sun Microsystems. In which case, we meant to say that Java is the best thing since the Magna Carta.</p>
                <h3>Java Woes: The Politically Correct Version</h3>
                <p>At times, companies have created their own Java Virtual Machines that differ subtly from Sun’s. Sun does not like that, and you can understand why. Java is not open source; it is a protected product. Differing Virtual Machines can sometimes prevent Java from fulfilling its promise. This has led some developers to avoid using Java. As a web designer, you will want to stay aware of these issues if there’s a possibility of their affecting your site and your users.</p>
                <p>Java can also sometimes drain the computer’s memory resources because the user is essentially running a second operating system (Java) within his existing <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. Not to mention the fact that the user is likely running a Java-based application on an unstable web browser with all its memory-hogging plug-ins, on top of any other software programs he might have running in the background, and on top of a possibly unstable base operating system such as an older version of Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, which can be wonderful but not entirely stable.</p>
                <p>The older the computer and the less memory at its disposal, the greater the possibility of woe. Attention, Sun attorneys: We do not wish to overstate these issues. All that is usually required is for the user to increase the amount of memory allotted to the browser. Unfortunately, most web users don’t realize this, so they don’t do it. Result: instability.</p>
                <p>The memory problem is not a Java problem per se; plug-ins like Flash and Shockwave also work better if the user increases his browser’s memory partition. Fortunately, during the installation process, Shockwave and Flash alert users to the issue and offer to increase the browser’s memory automatically if the user clicks the OK button. Java does not do this because Java is typically preinstalled on the user’s machine when it arrives from the factory.</p>
                <p>Given that browser makers know most users are going to encounter Java and are going to install and run plug-ins, why don’t they increase the default memory partition of their browsers? In a word: competition. The browser makers want to prove that their product uses less memory than the competitor’s, so the browser installs itself with the lowest memory allotment possible. It will operate under those conditions just fine as long as users rarely venture beyond all-text websites. Most users do venture far beyond, whether knowingly or not. So most users are practically guaranteed to encounter browser instability on sites that use Java or plug-ins or even large, memory-draining background images.</p>
                <p>Though Java tends to work well in Windows and UNIX, it’s a mixed bag in Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. Even on top-of-the-line G4 Macs with 1.5<abbr title="gigabytes">GB</abbr> of installed <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>, T3 connections, and system buses capable of transferring over 1<abbr title="gigabytes">GB</abbr> of data per second, Java can sour.</p>
                <p>These same Macs can rotate a 40<abbr title="megabyte">MB</abbr> Photoshop image faster than Google can track down your ex-girlfriend. At speeds exceeding 5.5 gigaflops, they can outperform Pentiums with twice the rated clock speed. But a stupid "rippling water" Java applet on a personal site at Geocities can take down these mighty Macs. Java is cross-platform but not always reliably so. Attention, lawyers: We do not wish to overstate these issues.</p>
                <p>Then of course, Java does not work at all in text-based browsers such as Lynx, nor will it function in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 2. And users of even the newest browsers might "turn off" Java in their preferences, thus defeating the development team’s efforts to use Java on the site.</p>
                <p>This is not a Java problem per se. Users can also turn off JavaScript and style sheets. They can refuse to install plug-ins, tell the browser to use "their" background colors instead of yours, and in every other way imaginable assert their right to see the Web as they wish to see it, thus turning your beautiful site into a sea of sewage that strangely pleases them.</p>
                <p>The workaround, as always, is to provide alternatives. Simple <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> menus and alternative content go a long way toward keeping sites accessible, no matter what technologies are intended for their use under optimal conditions. We do not wish to <em>understate</em> this issue. We wish to strongly emphasize it. Make accessibility part of the plan at all times.</p>
                <h3>Java Joys</h3>
                <p>Despite hiccups, Java is cross-platform, and it does many things very well, such as "stepping in" to replace missing plug-ins. For instance, as just described, Flash files can be run as Java applications in Netscape Navigator if the user does not have the Flash plug-in. That is fairly remarkable. It is handled by Flash itself. When saving the file, Flash generates code that will call upon a built-in Java action if the plug-in is not detected in the user’s browser.</p>
                <p>Beyond all that, Java applets and Java <em>servlets</em> (smaller, more stable mini-applications of Java that run on the server) can be used to help create dynamic, database-driven websites. Java is ideally suited for sophisticated tasks that take place under the hood. Because Java works cross-platform and cross-browser (despite problems just mentioned), it might be preferable to use Java for complex tasks, rather than relying on proprietary, platform-and browser-specific technologies such as <abbr title="Visual Basic">VB</abbr>Script and ActiveX.</p>
                <p>Java seems less valuable to us when it is used to create dynamic menus or to trigger the rotation of ad banners. In both cases, JavaScript/<abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script is a lighter, more stable choice that is also a web standard, tends to use fewer computing resources, and works better across platforms.</p>
                <p>Seeing as we’ve mentioned Java and JavaScript in the same paragraph, we might as well restate that the two technologies should not be confused, in spite of their similar names. JavaScript is a complex but interpreted programming language that works in web browsers. Java is a full-fledged, object-oriented programming environment that can drive entire devices or can be used to build complete applications. Nearly all web designers work with JavaScript, whether on the programming level or simply via cut-and-paste. No sane web designer attempts to program in Java. Even insane web designers avoid it.</p>
                <p>The true power of Java is now being manifested beyond the browser. Instead of web surfing, consumers are channel surfing via Java-powered <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> devices (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20001019071745/http://www-us.semiconductors.com/news/content/file_501.html" title="Check out what www-us.semiconductors.com/news/content/file_501.html looked like back in 2000.">www-us.semiconductors.com/news/content/file_501.html</a>). Java and Linux are now creating Internet appliances that require no understanding of Java or Linux (<a href="//www.linuxfordevices.com/c/a/News/New-LinuxJava-Internet-appliance-reference-platform" title="Check out what linuxdevices.com/news/NS5323294840.html looked like back in 2001.">http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS5323294840.html</a>). Java is finding its way into Personal Digital Assistants (<abbr title="Personal Digital Assistants">PDAs</abbr>), cell phones, and even server-side technologies (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010302170512/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/beyond/2.html" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/beyond/2.html looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/beyond/2.html</a>). Keep your eye on Java as your career unfolds, and use it judiciously as your sites evolve.</p>
                <h2>Rich Media: Exploding the "Page"</h2>
                <p>We say web "pages" because our minds cannot let go of the publishing model we grew up with. But rich web media give the lie to the "page" metaphor. These pages are <em>not</em> pages. This is not a pipe. This is not my beautiful wife.</p>
                <p>Let’s see how standard technologies and popular plug-ins push the Web way beyond the cosmologies of print design. We’ll start with some web standards you might or might not know about.</p>
                <h3>Virtual Reality Modeling Language (<abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr>)</h3>
                <p><abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr>, though nearly dead from disuse, is the standard language for the animation and <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> modeling of geometric shapes. It allows <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> scenes to be viewed and interactively manipulated on the Web. Using a special <em><abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> browser</em>, the web user can connect to an online <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> site, choose a <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> environment to explore, and cruise around the spooky "<abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> world." It is also possible to zoom in and out and to interact with the <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> environment in various ways. The Netscape Live<abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> browser (built into Netscape 3) was the first to support the <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> 1.0 standard.</p>
                <p>Think video game. Think cheesy, super-low-grade video game. Laura Croft it’s not. It’s more like Pacman <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr>. Think wireframe and black backgrounds.</p>
                <p>Besides being fairly crude, <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> is not a technology that lends itself to accessible alternatives. A <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image might be described via <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> and <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> text for the benefit of web users with visual disabilities. But you are either navigating a <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> environment, or you’re not. <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> text just won’t cut it: "If you could see and if you could physically manipulate a mouse cursor, you might enter a crude simulation of a living room and ‘pick up’ an illustration representing a pencil." Thanks for sharing.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> is fascinating but has few immediately apparent commercial benefits. Nor is it particularly dazzling in today’s world of Flash 5, <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>-based interactivity, and improved monitor and color resolutions. Perhaps for these reasons, the technology has never caught on the way that JavaScript, for example, caught on. Web users have a tough enough time finding what they want on most websites without adding primitive <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> effects to the mix.</p>
                <p>Of course, <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> was never about "web users finding what they want," and you might feel we’ve just slapped a straw man. But have we?</p>
                <p>Web-using veterans might recall a similar <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> experiment called <em>Hot Sauce</em> that was created by Apple Computer in the mid-1990s. Hot Sauce turned text-based directories into virtual <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> environments containing (you guessed it) text—text that floated in fake <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> space. To move from one block of text to the next, you eased your mouse up and down your desk.</p>
                <p>Instead of navigating <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240005/http://www.yahoo.com" title="Check out what yahoo.com looked like back in 2001.">Yahoo.com</a> the conventional way and finding what you wanted in under 30 seconds, with Hot Sauce you could spend hours painfully navigating a <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> version of the Yahoo directory. This was not most people’s idea of fun, and the technology soon petered out. Scientists do what they can; marketers do what sells. Hot Sauce did not sell, and neither did <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> because after you muttered, "Cool," there was little else to be said. Angry <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> and Hot Sauce fans, please send your protests to <a href="mailto:null@newriders.com">null@newriders.com</a>.</p>
                <p>Now that you know what <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr> is, you probably don’t need to know much more about it. If you’re curious, more information is available at The Web Developer’s Virtual Library:</p>

                <h3><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> and <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr></h3>
                <p>In the absence of finalized multimedia standards for the Web, plug-ins were developed that enabled websites to offer streaming video, animated vector graphics, music tracks, and the like. We are about to look at those very plug-ins. But first, let us pause to consider a recent development.</p>
                <p>Over the past couple of years, <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommendations have emerged to suggest standardized ways of doing what proprietary plug-ins already do so well. One of these is <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommendation for multimedia; the other is <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, intended to deliver vector graphics such as those already used in Flash (but with some essential differences from Flash).</p>
                <p>What’s up with these two new standards, and why do they matter?</p>
                <h4><abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> (through your fear and sorrow)</h4>
                <p><abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010404224820/http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo" title="Check out what w3.org/AudioVideo/ looked like back in 2001.">http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/</a>) stands for Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language and is pronounced, "smile." Isn’t that cute? Oh, shut up.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> is an easy-to-learn, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>-like language for creating "<abbr title="Television">TV</abbr>-like multimedia presentations such as training courses on the Web," according to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. The current <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> recommendation is 1.0, and you can read all about it at the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> address just cited and at another one we’ll mention later. This is our way of avoiding adding another 50 pages to this book.</p>
                <p>Aside from the fact that three Internet heavies (Real, Apple, and Adobe) are throwing their weight behind <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>, why should you care about any of this? Let’s see.</p>
                <h5>Harnessing media, helping users</h5>
                <p><abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> packs accessibility features (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010603003720/http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access" title="Check out what w3.org/TR/SMIL-access/ looked like back in 2001.">http://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL-access/</a>), including alternative text content that can be made available to Braille readers. Such content will also enable search engines to index multimedia web content authored in <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In English:</span> slap a QuickTime video on your site and search engines such as Google or Altavista could care less. But add a carefully authored <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> presentation to your site, and speeches made by the characters in your video could show up in Google and Altavista’s search results.</p>
                <p>The educational implications are enormous. A student researching Hamlet’s soliloquy could find a <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>-authored video of Sir Laurence Olivier performing it. The Web’s potential as the world’s library could suddenly become much richer.</p>
                <p>The commercial implications ain’t bad, either. A buyer searching for widgets could find your client’s digitized promotional video on the subject. Existing multimedia formats obviously do not offer these advantages.</p>
                <p>Lest you think <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> is a completely wacky new technology, it is, in fact, simply a markup language that works with existing technologies like QuickTime and Real digital video and audio. What <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> does is bring the traditional benefits of the Web (searching, finding, bookmarking) to non-text content. That is profound.</p>
                <h5>More reasons to <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr></h5>
                <p>Other cool things you can do with <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>With a single link, you can deliver audio to dialup users and video to broadband users. None of that "click here for audio, click here for video" junk.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Deliver different language versions of clips depending on a user’s system-language setting.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Use back-end technologies to deliver multimedia content on the fly. No need for expensive, proprietary programs with steep learning curves. (<abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> delivers similar benefits.)</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>…All with a few simple tags.</p>
                <h5>Author! Author!</h5>
                <p>Among the currently available Web tools and plug-ins that support <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> are Apple QuickTime 4.1 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101041748/http://www.apple.com/quicktime" title="Check out what apple.com/quicktime looked like back in 2001.">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/</a>) and the unfortunately named RealSlideshow authoring tool by the makers of the RealPlayer (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101271247/http://proforma.real.com/rn/tools/slideshow/index.html?" title="Check out what proforma.real.com/rn/tools/slideshow/index.html? looked like back in 2001.">http://proforma.real.com/rn/tools/slideshow/index.html?</a>). Adobe is presently developing a <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> extension for its GoLive <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> tool, which should simplify the creation of <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> content and might help accelerate the standard’s adoption.</p>
                <p>RealSystem’s support for <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> has been solid since 1998. Given the number of RealPlayers out there, <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> can already reach almost as many web users as Flash does. Not that <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> and Flash are enemies. <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> is often used to integrate Flash content into the QuickTime and RealPlayers, and Flash 5 exports <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> for use in RealSystem.</p>
                <p>SMILsoftware’s Flution 1.5 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010301213116/http://smilsoftware.com" title="Check out what smilsoftware.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.smilsoftware.com/</a>) for Windows can streamline the <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> creation process. Tom Wlodkowksy’s free Media Access Generator (MAGpie) for Windows (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010617125237/http://ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/magpie" title="Check out what ncam.wgbh.org/webaccess/magpie looked like back in 2001.">http://main.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/ncam/webaccess/magpie/</a>) adds accessibility features such as closed-captioning to <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>. For a more detailed description of the goals of the <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> language, see the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Activity Statement (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010405080929/http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/Activity.html" title="Check out what w3.org/AudioVideo/Activity.html looked like back in 2001.">http://www.w3.org/ AudioVideo/Activity.html</a>) on Synchronized Multimedia.

                <h3><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> for You and Me</h3>
                <p><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> (Scalable Vector Graphics) is a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standard in progress. As of this writing, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> describes its initial <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> activities as "currently nearing completion" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101282218/http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8" title="Check out what w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8 looked like back in 2001.">http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/Overview.htm8</a>). Though <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> produces vector graphics, it is a markup language. In fact, it is an application of <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, the super-meta-markup language we’ve mentioned throughout this book.</p>
                <p>Like Flash vector graphics, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> vector graphics can fill an entire screen with artwork while using very little bandwidth. Also like Flash, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> can be animated via scripting. You’ll find examples of this at Adobe’s <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> site, which we’ll discuss in a moment (see Figures 12.5 and 12.6).</p>

                        <p>Vector artwork maintains quality at the highest magnifications while keeping bandwidth expenditure at a minimum (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040105/http://www.adobe.com" title="Check out what adobe.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.adobe.com/</a>).</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">No matter its graphic appearance, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> remains text. To understand the implications of that fact, let’s contrast <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> with our present production techniques. We’ll use an example that’s close to every designer’s heart: the client’s logo.</p>
                <h4>Romancing the logo</h4>
                <p>For the purposes of this little exercise, we’ll assume that the client’s logo involves letterforms rather than nonverbal swooshes or swirls. We’ll further assume that you’re developing the logo in Adobe Illustrator and that you have not yet converted your text to outlines. After it becomes outlines, it ceases to be text, thus losing the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> benefit we’re about to explore.</p>
                <p>First, the traditional methods:</p>
                <p>If you export your client’s logo from Illustrator to Photoshop and embed it on a web page as a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image, search engines will not index it because it is not text. You can work around that limitation by adding <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> text to your image tag, but not all search engines index all <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> text.</p>
                <p>If you create that same logo in Flash, it can spin and whirl and glow, but search engines will not index it because it is not text. Flash 5 has added some accessibility features, allowing you, for instance, to include <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> text for a Flash file, but this is global text, not image-specific text, and we already talked about the limitations of <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> tags as a guarantor of search engine placement.</p>
                <p>Now, the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> method:</p>
                <p>Take that same Illustrator logo and export it as <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, using Illustrator’s built-in support for that web standard. The resulting logo looks great, smells fresh, and <em>it remains text</em>. That means search engines can index it.</p>
                <p>Your client’s logo no longer blushes like a maiden when the search engine comes courting. From every page of the site, the text-based logo calls out to the search engine, and the search engine rewards it with the Web’s greatest mark of love: a high ranking.</p>
                <p>To the eye, the logo is a logo; to the search engine, it is a word. If the word "Widgets" appears at the top of every page of the site, that site will rank high when users search for widgets. When the client cries, "Make the logo bigger," you can answer: "We’ve made it number one." By contrast, under the old methods, when a <em><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image</em> of the word "Widgets" appears at the top of every page of the site, it is unlikely to seduce the search engines.</p>
                <p>Because the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>-formatted Widgets logo is a <em>word that looks like a logo</em>, users can also copy and paste it into a text document. It will lose its <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> formatting when users do this, but your client’s name will remain intact. Your client will like that. And who knows? A year from now, it might not lose its formatting when pasted into a popular word processor, print layout program, or email message.</p>
                <p>In fact that is one of the promises of <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> for graphic designers: that we will be able to use the same <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> image file in our print work and our web work—from Illustrator to Quark to the website, as easy as drag and drop. (Yes, you can also create <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> illustrations by hand-coding them—after all, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> is really <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>—but we doubt many designers will want to do that. We sure don’t.)</p>
                <p>Will <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> replace Flash? Not likely and certainly not any time soon. Will <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> evolve into a useful tool for creating scriptable vector graphics? We think it will.</p>
                <h4>Sounds dandy, but will it work?</h4>
                <p><abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> support is coming online slowly. A plug-in from Adobe (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010213232821/http://www.adobe.com/svg/main.html" title="Check out what adobe.com/svg/main.html looked like back in 2000.">http://www.adobe.com/svg/main.html</a>) supports <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> in all web browsers, though not equally well. The first version of the Adobe plug-in relied on Netscape-proprietary plug-in detection that was not supported in Internet Explorer for Macintosh. Users of <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac could not see <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> graphics at all with that plug-in version.</p>
                <p>As of this writing, a newer Adobe <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> plug-in has greatly improved its support for non-Netscape browsers, though Internet Explorer support for Macs is limited to nonscripted <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> only. In other words, <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>/Mac users can see <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> graphics on the Web but cannot see dynamic (animated) <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> graphics.</p>
                <p>Still, things are looking up for <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>. You might find it odd that it takes a proprietary plug-in to support an open standard, but such is the state of the Web. After the <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> standard is finalized, we suspect that browser makers will begin investigating ways to support it.</p>
                <h3>Promises, Promises</h3>
                <p>While <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> is well-supported via plug-ins, <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> is still a work in progress—a promising work in progress, an exciting work in progress, but a work in progress. It will be widely adopted when it is further along in development and can be natively supported in browsers.</p>
                <p>Do these tools, <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> and <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, pose an immediate threat to Macromedia Flash? They certainly do not. In fact, we don’t see them as anti-Flash technologies at all (though some might view them that way).</p>
                <p>While <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> is expanding and <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> is still taking shape, now would be a good time to download Adobe’s <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> plug-in and explore <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> presentations and tutorials. Over the coming months, you will want to remain open-minded about these emerging standards and keep your eye on their evolution. Before we know it, they will likely be part of every web designer’s tool kit.</p>
                <p>But in the meantime, you have a job to do. So let us turn our gaze to the Web’s <em>de facto</em> multimedia "standards" (which are not, technically speaking, web standards at all). Let’s consider the proprietary, often-maligned, sometimes-adored, widely used plug-ins that already bring rich multimedia experiences to hundreds of thousands of sites and hundreds of millions of web users.</p>
                <h2>Turn on, Tune in, Plug-in</h2>
                <p>Plug-ins are the chief means by which web designers currently add sound and motion to the Web, and web users employ them to extend the capability of their browsers, allowing them to see and hear these sound and motion effects. Browser can’t play music? Pop in a plug-in. Browser can’t show vector graphics? Pop in a plug-in. Browser can’t show 360-degree panoramic views of the client’s flagship $599 running shoe? Pop in a plug-in.</p>

                        <p>Sony Classical, a site that Flash built. What it loses in accessibility, it gains in form and function. Classical music greets the visitor as the site loads; as one piece of music replaces another, the company’s musical offerings shift in the main window as though one were poring through record bins (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101061208/http://www.sonyclassical.com" title="Check out what sonyclassical.com looked like back in 2000.">http://www.sonyclassical.<wbr>com/</a>). You can do some of this in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and JavaScript but not as smoothly or reliably.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">For graphic designers, plug-ins are nothing new. If you want to create strange blurs in Photoshop, you can buy and install Kai Krause’s <abbr title="Kai's Power Tools">KPT</abbr> Filters plug-ins. If you wish to work with preset masks in Photoshop, you’d purchase Extensis Photoframe. Photoshop and Quark have sparked entire industries devoted to creating such plug-ins. Plug-ins for web browsers function exactly like plug-ins for Photoshop and Quark, except that browser plug-ins are free. (Why are they free? How can they be free? We’ll get to that.)</p>
                <p>The other difference between designer plug-ins and browser plug-ins is that browser plug-ins are as essential to the end-user as they are to the creator. Your client does not need <abbr title="Kai's Power Tools">KPT</abbr> Filters to see the way you’ve blurred his logo in Photoshop, but web users need the Flash plug-in to view your Flash work, the Real plug-in to see and hear your Real-encoded video, and so on.</p>
                <h3>A Hideous Breach of Reality</h3>
                <p>Some plug-ins are <em>true</em> plug-ins, invisibly doing their work inside the browser. Others are more like free-standing players, though their manufacturers still refer to them as plug-ins, and most web designers call them that as well. Of course they should be called "helper applications" if they aren’t actually plug-ins, as they have been for years by persnickety people who also pronounce "<abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>" correctly.</p>
                <p>Still other multimedia add-ons can work either way. Depending on how you mark up your web page, Apple’s QuickTime plug-in can lurk in the shadows, invisibly playing embedded video and audio files right in the browser window (like a plug-in). It also can spawn an overly ornate steel-burnished console player that lies atop the browser window like a misbegotten Cadillac ornament (<em>not</em> like a plug-in).</p>
                <p>To keep it simple and to annoy the overly precise among you, we will follow the manufacturers’ lead (as well as convention) and refer to all of these add-ons as "plug-ins," whether they behave like true plug-ins or not.</p>
                <h4>The ubiquity of plug-ins</h4>
                <p>Plug-ins have been a fact of web life and web design since the mid-1990s. Why plug-ins? How did it happen?</p>
                <p>In the beginning, God created the Heavens and the Earth. A little later, the Web consisted of hyperlinked text. In the fullness of time, it became possible to include badly rendered images on web pages. This began to make the medium more attractive to creative and commercial enterprises, and there was soon a demand for sound, video, and other multimedia enhancements on the Web. There was also a demand for really good Chinese food in the American Midwest.</p>
                <p>How to answer the clamor for sound and video and other fancy stuff? The engineers at Netscape were inventing what a web browser was supposed to be as they went along. Eventually they hit upon the notion of plug-ins. If it worked for Quark and Photoshop, it ought to work for them too.</p>
                <p>At the time, the Web was hotter than Jennifer Lopez’s Academy Awards dress, and Netscape’s browser was the thing that was making it hot. Here was a marketing opportunity! Dozens of plug-ins soon flung themselves into the market. When new browsers began muscling in on Netscape’s turf, they followed Netscape’s lead and supported "Netscape plug-ins" simply to compete.</p>
                <p>And here we are, more than half a decade on and still plugging away. (There is still no good Chinese food in the American Midwest, however.)</p>
                <h2>The Impossible Lightness of Plug-Ins</h2>
                <p>Any web designer has much to say about plug-ins, not all of it printable, and we are no exception. Truth is, we could write a whole book about plug-ins. Come to think of it, we could write a book about just one plug-in. In fact, many people have. Hillman Curtis, for instance, wrote <em>Flash Web Design: The Art of Motion Graphics</em>, New Riders: 2000 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012040308/http://www.newriders.com/books/title.cfm?isbn=0735708967" title="Check out what newriders.com/books/title.cfm?isbn=0735708967 looked like back in 2000.">http://www.newriders.com/books/title.cfm?isbn=0735708967</a>).</p>
                <p>Want in-depth help with Flash, and penetrating insights into its nature? Try Hillman’s book or Joshua Davis’s upcoming <em>Flash to the Core</em> (New Riders: 2001). We have our hands full as it is. Meantime, let’s assess a few well-known plug-ins.</p>
                <h3>Plug-ins Most Likely to Succeed</h3>
                <p>There are as many plug-ins as there are stars in the heavens. Plug-ins for specialty uses, plug-ins for novelty uses, plug-ins that support the needs of mathematical and scientific markup, plug-ins that let you print official <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> postage from your web browser. No, we’re not kidding. Pour yourself a strong beverage and hit <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101032055/http://www.home.netscape.com/plugins" title="Check out what home.netscape.com/plugins looked like back in 2001.">http://home.netscape.com/plugins/</a> to take in the range of available plug-ins. Do you have to learn about all these plug-ins? No.</p>
                <p>When designing content that requires plug-ins, the first question to ask is, which plug-ins? Which are most widely available? Which are likely to be sitting in your visitor’s browser plug-in folder, just waiting for you to give them something to play?</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this question is easier to ask than answer. An assessment of which plug-ins come preloaded in which browsers does little to clarify the state of plug-in-hood. As mentioned in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, both Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator include the Apple QuickTime plug-in in their distributions. That much is known.</p>
                <p>Netscape also includes the RealPlayer and Shockwave/Flash. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> for Windows, the most popular browser/platform combination, includes the Windows Media Player but not RealPlayer. Most Windows distributions of Explorer include Flash (but not Shockwave); Mac Explorer distributions include neither. By the time you read this, all of this might have changed. That’s marketing, kids.</p>
                <p>Seeing that you’re no better off than you were before, we’ve gone ahead and created a short list of plug-ins we think you’ll run into during your long and splendid web design career. Herewith, please review our never-impartial assessment of the major multimedia plug-ins.</p>
                <h4>RealPlayer (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040126/http://www.real.com" title="Check out what real.com looked like back in 2001.">www.real.com</a>)</h4>
                <p>This popular plug-in/player delivers streaming video and audio, along with support for Flash and the <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr> standard. RealPlayer is the most popular streaming video format because it uses the least bandwidth and works on all computing platforms (though it’s sometimes flaky on Macs).</p>
                <p>As explained in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, <em>streaming video</em> is video that plays while downloading. Early plug-in technologies did not stream. The viewer had to wait for an entire movie or sound file to download before she could see or hear the file in her browser. Real was the first to offer streaming playback.</p>
                <h5>Dull technical note</h5>
                <p>Even when a player supports streaming, a small amount of data must be downloaded and cached before streaming begins to ensure smooth playback. If the file were to begin playing immediately, playback could be interrupted later on—for instance, when other network traffic momentarily interfered with the stream. By preloading (downloading and caching) initial data, the player attempts to offer smooth, uninterrupted playback. Apple QuickTime and Windows Media Player, discussed in the following section, are also streaming formats.</p>
                <h5>Tool tips</h5>
                <p>The free Real Producer software available at Real’s site is of sufficient quality for converting existing digital video to the Real format. An inexpensive "Pro" version provides more options, enables you to create <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> files, and will help you create <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files and stub files. <em>Stub files</em> are miniature text files that trigger the streaming of Real files over conventional http networks. You also can easily create stub files yourself:</p>
                <p>If <span class="orange">lopez_dress.rm</span> is a Real-encoded file featuring Jennifer Lopez in her famous Academy Awards dress, and if that file resides at <span class="orange">http://www.example.com/real/lopez_dress.rm</span>, to force the file to stream over a conventional web server, you need to create a stub file. Open a blank text document (Write, SimpleText, BBEdit, Text-Edit, any basic text editor will do). In this blank document, type the address of the Real file:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">http://www.example.com/real/lopez_dress.rm</span></p>
                <p>Close the document and save it as <span class="orange">lopez_dress.ram</span>. That’s your stub file, Bubba. Upload it to your web server—for the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume you’ve uploaded it to the same directory as the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> file that references it—and then conjure it up with a link like this:</p>
                <p><code class="nopad">&lt;a href="lopez_dress.ram">La Lopez!&lt;/a></code></p>
                <p>Can you refer to it with an image instead? Of course. It’s just a link.</p>
                <p><code>&lt;a href="lopez_dress.ram">&lt;img src="images/lopez_50x50.gif" height="50" width="50" alt="Actress Jennifer Lopez" title="Watch Jennifer Lopez at the Academy Awards. RealPlayer required." Border="0">&lt;/a></code></p>
                <p>You can also <code class="nopad">&lt;EMBED></code> the file, thereby triggering the Real plug-in instead of the Real console:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;embed src=" lopez_dress.ram" autostart="true" volume="100" width="2" height="2" controls="hidden" pluginspage="http://www.real.com"></code></p>
                <p>What does all that extra code mean? We’ll explain later.</p>
                <p>The point is to link to the stub file, not the actual Real-encoded file. The stub file, being text, downloads almost instantly. If the user’s browser is configured correctly, the stub file will launch the RealPlayer, which will then begin preloading the actual video clip. Your visitors will soon see Jennifer Lopez...and so will Ms. Lopez’s attorneys. Be certain you have permission to publish the clip.</p>
                <p>You can skip the need for stub files if your client or host purchases dedicated Real servers—recommended if you plan to serve much video to many visitors. For instance, on a site that constantly serves <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> news feeds, cable comedy clips, or streaming video trailers, investing in Real servers would be a Real good idea.</p>
                <h5>Special indications</h5>
                <p>With the highest compression ratio (and consequently, the lowest quality), Real is the fastest streaming format, making it the plug-in of choice for news sites and others where quality is less important than a hardy constitution and the ability to deliver like James Brown. With Real, you are assured of supporting the largest number of users with the widest range of connection speeds.</p>
                <p>If video files are meant to viewed and then forgotten (like a <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> experience), Real is likely what you want. Conversely, if video files are meant to be stored and treasured on the end-user’s hard drive, you would probably choose QuickTime instead. This is, of course, merely our opinion.</p>
                <h4>QuickTime (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101041748/http://www.apple.com/quicktime" title="Check out what apple.com/quicktime looked like back in 2001.">www.apple.com/quicktime/</a>)</h4>
                <p>A high-quality streaming video format, QuickTime also supports a wide variety of streaming audio formats including the ever-popular <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr>. It also delivers QuickTime <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> panoramas and animated sprites. QuickTime supports hyperlinks in video, and offers some support for Flash and <abbr title="Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language">SMIL</abbr>. An innovative multistreaming process serves appropriately sized material according to the end-user’s connection speed, as described in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
                <p>Last time we checked, QuickTime was the second most popular streaming format. It uses more bandwidth than RealPlayer but delivers smoother video and audio. The QuickTime format is native to Apple Macintosh computers but thoroughly supports Windows <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s.</p>
                <h5>Tool tips</h5>
                <p>Delivering video over the Web should be impossible. The technology works by means of drastic compression methods. Even the best of these methods include visible artifacts. To minimize these artifacts and assure a better quality image, choose subject matter that compresses well.</p>
                <p>"Talking heads" compress well. Swish pans and mad action sequences do not. This is because the compression works by seeking pixels that barely change from frame to frame, choosing one of these pixels as a "master" pixel, and repeating it from frame to frame in hopes of fooling your eye. The more jerky camera movement in your <em>mise-en-scene</em>, the more obvious the software sleight-of-hand is. This is true not only for QuickTime but for all digital video.</p>
                <p>QuickTime <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> panoramas can be breathtaking, and various software products are available to help you stitch together individual photographs into a full <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> panorama, including Apple QuickTime <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> Authoring Studio (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240444/http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtvr/authoringstudio" title="Check out what apple.com/quicktime/qtvr/authoringstudio looked like back in 2001.">http://www.apple.com/quicktime/qtvr/authoringstudio/</a>). You can insert sound effects in these panoramas and confine the effects to certain portions of the panorama. See Figures 12.8, 12.9, and 12.10 for nonprofit and noncommercial QuickTime <abbr title="Virtual Reality">VR</abbr> panoramas at Heidsite and <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101041941/http://www.pbs.org" title="Check out what pbs.org looked like back in 2001.">PBS.org</a>.</p>

                <h4>Windows Media Player (<abbr title="Windows Media Player">WMP</abbr>) (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010322201800/http://microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/en/default.asp" title="Check out what microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia looked like back in 2001.">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/</a>)</h4>
                <p><abbr title="Windows Media Player">WMP</abbr> delivers streaming video and audio in the Windows Media File (<abbr title="Windows Media File">WMF</abbr>) format and is included in all distributions of the various Windows operating systems, making it a popular plug-in indeed. Though <abbr title="Windows Media Player">WMP</abbr> is viewed as a plug-in that primarily supports Windows users, a version is available for Macintosh folk, and it actually works well. The player supports real-time capture and broadcast of audio and video files (making it competitive with RealPlayer) and also handles <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> audio as smoothly as its competitors.</p>
                <p>According to Microsoft, Windows Media Player supports "near-<abbr title="Digital Video Disc">DVD</abbr>-quality" video and "near-<abbr title="Compact Disc">CD</abbr>-quality" sound. A free Windows Media Encoder makes it as easy to prepare video materials for distribution as streaming <abbr title="Windows Media File">WMF</abbr> files.

                <p>For some reason, <abbr title="Windows Media File">WMF</abbr> has apparently become the format of choice for the streaming distribution of "adult" content, or so our informants tell us. We just thought it was kind of interesting, that’s all. You try writing a chapter about plug-ins, and see if your mind doesn’t start wandering where it shouldn’t. We blame Jennifer Lopez’s dress.</p>

                <p>Musician Thomas Dolby’s Beatnik, though less widespread than the biggest hitters, is an intriguing plug-in that comes bundled with most Netscape distributions. Beatnik enhances <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) playback, easily surpassing the quality of most <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> add-on sound cards and the Mac’s built-in <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> voices. It also offers strangely wonderful features, such as the ability to mix jam sessions on sites authored according to Beatnik’s specifications.</p>
                <p>Such stuff is unlikely to be part of a site for your local church, synagogue, or small business but might well add luster to the site for a recording artist. Beatnik was used to enhance the <abbr title="Public Broadcasting Service">PBS</abbr> "Jazz" site (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101232200/http://www.pbs.org/jazz" title="Check out what pbs.org/jazz looked like back in 2001.">http://www.pbs.org/jazz/</a>) that accompanied Ken Burns’s historic jazz documentary series of 2001.</p>
                <p>Beatnik works in Netscape (all platforms) and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> (Windows only). It unfortunately does not work in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac because its JavaScript functionality relies on proprietary Netscape Application Programming Interfaces (<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s). Beatnik is a cool plug-in, and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac is an extremely polished, standards-compliant web browser. It seems a pity that the two cannot work together, but this raises the whole trouble with plug-ins, which we cover later in this chapter (see "The Trouble with Plug-ins").</p>

                <p>Two plug-ins now bundled as one, Shockwave and Flash, are the biggest, most-accepted, and possibly the most dynamic plug-ins on the market. They are certainly the most controversial. Entire sites have been created in these formats. Entire sermons have been written denouncing them. For many, Flash is a religion; for many others, it is the first sign of the anti-Christ. Flash artist Peter Balogh sums up the controversy in his witty essay, "Sympathy for the Plug-in" at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010428132204/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/sympathy" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/sympathy looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/sympathy/</a>.</p>

                <p class="clearfix">Though they share a similar blow-you-away quality and though the manufacturer now serves them like two peas in a pod, Shockwave and Flash are quite different.</p>
                <h5>Shockwave</h5>
                <p>Shockwave is a sophisticated, proprietary format that can do anything a <abbr title="Compact Disc">CD</abbr>-<abbr title="Read Only Memory">ROM</abbr> can do. Full-fledged gaming environments; animated, hot-linked city maps; endless labyrinths deep within simulated subterranean worlds: If you can dream it up, it can be rendered in Shockwave. Essentially, Shockwave files are like self-contained software programs that launch in the user’s browser.</p>
                <p>As might be obvious, the more complex and multileveled the Shockwave file, the larger it must be to do its job. Thus there is a trade-off between sophisticated presentation and amount of bandwidth required.</p>
                <p>There is also the risk that Shockwave programs will exceed the user’s computing capacity. Linux users, who take justifiable pride in cranking tremendous computing juice out of old, cheap <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s, frequently hit a wall when Shockwave comes to town. Even Mac and <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> users sometimes find Shockwave too rich for their blood. None of this is the fault of the operating systems in question. We’re back to the problem we discussed with Java. When it works, it’s magnificent; when it doesn’t, it ain’t.</p>
                <p>Shockwave files are created in Macromedia Director, a multimedia production and programming package requiring tremendous expertise. No web designer is expected to know how to program in Director, though some specialize in it.</p>
                <p>"Hip" web agencies generally have a Shockwave master or two in their design departments—so do many "unhip" agencies. (We’re not sure what "hip" and "unhip" actually mean in the context of web design and development, but some web agencies seem to care a lot about it. In this, they take their cue from ad agencies.)</p>
                <p>Shockwave development is an art unto itself. It coincides with web design but is not the same as web design. Shockwave has nothing to do with the structured, semantic Web of meaning and information—but then neither does a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image file.</p>
                <p>Shockwave has largely escaped the fire and brimstone preached against its younger cousin, Flash, because Shockwave files are fiendishly difficult to create; therefore, gigantic Shockwave "intros" are not epidemic throughout the Web. Hence the usability experts rarely scream about Shockwave. But, oh brother, do they roar about Flash.</p>
                <h5>Flash</h5>
                <p>Flash is Shockwave’s lighter, less-bandwidth-intensive, easier-to-program (but somewhat less powerful) cousin. Flash delivers animated graphics and sound, and it is completely interactive. At this point in the history of the Web, it is easier to create rich interactive presentations in Flash than by trying to use the open standards of the Web (<abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript, and the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>). It’s more reliable, too, sadly enough.</p>
                <p>Flash files stream and can be highly compressed because Flash is built on vector graphics. (As you know, vector graphics, like PostScript, are mathematical in nature rather than pixel-based.) Thus it is somewhat ironic that Flash has become known as a bloated format. This has to do with poor Flash authoring, not with Flash. Flash presentations, even incredibly sophisticated ones, can be very low in bandwidth—and generally ought to be.</p>
                <p>Flash files are created in the Macromedia Flash authoring program. They also can be authored with Adobe’s LiveMotion software, which premiered in early 2000.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">Sixty second software review:</span> LiveMotion is easier for beginners to learn, particularly if they are familiar with the Adobe interface found in Photoshop, Illustrator, and so on. It does one or two things Flash can’t do. Flash, with a more baffling interface and a steeper learning curve, is initially harder to learn. But its programming depth, through Action Script and standard JavaScript, far exceeds that of LiveMotion (at least as of this writing).</p>
                <p><span class="orange">Cult take:</span> Flash designers take as much pride in mastering the tool’s absurdly poor interface as they do in exploring its programming depth and complexity. Just as web designers who code by hand take pains to chuckle mockingly at Dreamweaver and GoLive users—and hold FrontPage users utterly beneath contempt—so the hardcore Flash jockeys shake their heads in bewilderment at the very notion that anyone would even think of using LiveMotion.</p>
                <p>Remember, this is not necessarily our opinion; it is mere observation of a cultural milieu. If it sounds like Flash is a cult, it is. If it sounds like hardcore web design is also a cult, it is. If it sounds like you should reconsider getting involved in web design, you’ve read too far and know too much to escape unscathed.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">Our opinion:</span> Flash and LiveMotion are both fine tools, each of which caters to a different niche in the market. (There goes our cult status.)</p>
                <p>Whichever authoring tool you use, you can do all the design work in the program itself or create your vector graphics in Adobe Illustrator or Macromedia Freehand and then export them to Flash (or LiveMotion). You also might find yourself working with audio and video editing programs and <abbr title="three dimensional">3D</abbr> design programs. If you think we’re going to cram this book with quick ‘n easy tutorials on those sophisticated software programs, you are very high and should lie down or consult a physician.</p>
                <h5>Tips on authoring Flash</h5>
                <p>Buy the program. Read the manual. What do you want from us?</p>
                <p>Look at great Flash sites. Look at poor Flash sites. Emulate the good; learn from the bad.</p>
                <p>Good Flash sites are dynamic, attractive, navigable, intuitive, communicative, and respectful of the visitor’s bandwidth and time—just like all good websites.</p>
                <p>Bad Flash sites are unresponsive, static, hard to navigate and understand, communicate poorly (if at all), and waste the visitor’s bandwidth and time—just like bad websites.</p>
                <p>As with all such proclamations, there are always exceptions that succeed in spite of being cryptic, initially confusing, or bandwidth-intensive. If you are a genius with a deserved cult following, feel free to ignore the previous two paragraphs. If you’re not, respect your audience.</p>
                <p>Choose vector graphics over raster graphics to conserve bandwidth. When you must use raster graphics, use images that have been optimized to death, rather than lovely images that suck bandwidth. A static four-color <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> might not cut it on a traditional, static web page, but once that low-grade image is set in motion, viewers will respond to the motion without scrutinizing the quality of the image.</p>

Its prototype, the SHORN project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182147/http://www.shorn.com" title="Check out what shorn.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.shorn.com/</a>), makes extensive use of four-color <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s, and no one has ever noticed or complained.</p>
                <h5>What Flash is great for</h5>
                <p>Flash excels as an environment for the creation of rich works of art such as Monocrafts (see Figures 12.12, 12.13, and 12.14), Volume One (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010506000152/http://www.volumeone.com/01spring/index.html" title="Check out what volumeone.com looked like back in 2001.">www.volumeone.com/</a>), Once Upon A Forest (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010401082324/http://once-upon-a-forest.com" title="Check out what once-upon-a-forest.com looked like back in 2001.">www.once-upon-a-forest.com</a>), and many others you’ll meet in <a href="13.html" title="Check out chapter 13.">Chapter 13</a>.</p>

                <h5 class="clearfix">What Flash is not so great for</h5>
                <p>Flash is not so great for structured data, semantic markup, accessibility, searchability, indexability, and bookmarking. In short, nearly everything we associate with the Web.</p>
                <h5>Why Flash gets a bad rap</h5>
                <p>Refer to the previous answer.</p>
                <h5>Why else Flash gets a bad rap</h5>
                <p>Refer to the previous answer.</p>
                <h5>Still more reasons why Flash gets a bad rap</h5>
                <p>There are several things, really. For one, too many copycat designers use Flash in unimaginative, "me-too" ways. Thus, every other corporate site seems to launch with a giant spinning logo rendered in Flash.</p>
                <p>These miserable things are called "intros" (as in introduction) to the site. They are the spiritual descendants of David Siegel’s (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010301222124/http://www.dsiegel.com" title="Check out what dsiegel.com looked like back in 2001.">www.dsiegel.com/</a>) "entrance tunnels," meaning that while some of them can be beautiful establishers of mood, tone, and identity, too many feel simply gratuitous.</p>
                <p>Here is a true horror story. The author of this book was supposed to speak at a web conference. He visited the conference site in hopes that it would tell him where the event was being held. He knew it was in a hotel, but which hotel, and where? Instead of providing that information, the conference site linked to the third-party site of the hotel itself (strike one). Not the most usable idea, but all right.</p>
                <p>The hapless author clicked the hotel site link and discovered that he was trapped inside the conference site’s frameset, an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> error so basic he’d forgotten such things could even happen. Strike two.</p>
                <p>Inside that tiny frameset, the hotel site presented, not its name or address, but a Flash intro (strike three), nor was this an optimized, bandwidth-friendly intro built largely with vector graphics. No, what it actually was, was something more akin to a QuickTime movie: a motion picture showing the beauty of the hotel. Strike four. In spite of his fast connection, the author had to wait several times while the overweight Flash file choked on its own girth before streaming resumed. Strike five. There was no way to skip this intro; it simply had to be endured. Strike six.</p>
                <p>When the low-resolution but high-bandwidth graphic nightmare finally ended and the expiring Flash file triggered a standard <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> page, that page did not list the hotel’s address. Strike seven. The author had to navigate three layers deep into the site before he could find that simple, essential bit of information. In baseball you get three strikes. On the Web, you might not even get one. We needed to locate that hotel’s address because we had no choice but to show up there. Travelers planning a trip have many hotels to choose from. Word up.</p>
                <p>And that’s another reason that Flash gets a bad rap—because people who don’t know what they’re doing often use it poorly. There are bad painters, but no one criticizes paint. On the other hand, bad paintings aren’t shoved in your face when you’re trying to find information online.</p>
                <p>A "Flash usability" site at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102010855/http://flazoom.com" title="Check out what flazoom.com looked like back in 2001.">www.flazoom.com</a> can help you avoid designing useless or less-than-usable Flash movies; beyond that, the issues we discuss throughout this book are equally applicable to the world of Flash. Base your work on the needs of your audience; create intuitive structures that invite your specific audience to enter, explore, and linger; craft a memorable identity without wasting bandwidth...you know the drill by now.</p>
                <p>Clients might salivate over the prospect of giant animated logos, but designers and web users are tired of this unimaginative use of Flash, and the plug-in is best reserved for truly creative and artistic purposes. You’ll find sites exemplifying that kind of creativity in <a href="13.html" title="Check out chapter 13.">Chapter 13</a>.</p>
                <h5>Another reason Flash gets a bad rap</h5>
                <p>Failure to provide alternatives, thus leaving some users in the dust, is a widespread problem. Macromedia has begun an initiative to make Flash sites more accessible, and this is commendable. But streaming audio and visual media, accessed by mouse movements, will always remain inaccessible for some (refer to the preceding discussion of <abbr title="Virtual Reality Modeling Language">VRML</abbr>).</p>
                <p>Unless Flash is able to overcome tremendous barriers to accessibility (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101232217/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/unclear" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/unclear looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/unclear/</a>) inherent in its very nature, it is vital to provide some kind of basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> alternative for those who might be unable to see or hear or move their limbs.</p>
                <h5>Embedding Flash files in web pages</h5>
                <p>Flash generates all the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> necessary to embed a Flash movie in a web page. Isn’t that nice? You might, of course, want to go in and further massage the markup.</p>
                <h5>Are we finished with Flash?</h5>
                <p>We will never be finished with Flash, but we’ve pretty much finished discussing it in this chapter.</p>
                <h2>Who Makes the Salad? Web Designers and Plug-Ins</h2>
                <p>As a web designer, you will rarely be asked to develop content for plug-ins (with the possible exception of Flash). QuickTime and Real video files, for example, are usually created by web producers or design technicians—not by web designers. Sometimes the people who actually shoot and edit the film will generate digitized versions as part of the post-production process.</p>
                <p>If you do find yourself pressed into service in these areas, the work is not hard. In agencies, you’ll typically find a workstation with a video machine at one end and a Mac or <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> at the other. Software like Adobe Premiere or Apple iMovie is used to digitize the film. Third-party compression software such as Terran Cleaner 5 (<a href="" title="Unfortunately this link is dead. :-(">http://www.terran.com/</a>) optimizes video for streaming web delivery. None of this is difficult, but rarely will a web designer be asked to do it. Your time is too valuable elsewhere.</p>
                <p>Many web designers include Flash design in their skills repertoire; many others do not. Developing <em>exceptional</em> Flash content is a specialization all its own. Most web agencies keep a few designers on staff who excel at Flash development, allowing the bulk of the design crew to focus on interface and other design issues.</p>
                <p>So if web designers generally do not create plug-in content, what do web designers have to do with plug-ins? They make them work on web pages—that’s what.</p>
                <h3>Making It Work: Providing Options</h3>
                <p>Web designers use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to embed a plug-in file (or object) on a web page. Following is markup from an IPIX panorama page at the Travel Channel (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010329184759/http://travel.discovery.com/tools/gallerypages/ipix/noam/wmiss/zabptcaj.html" title="Check out what travel.discovery.com/tools/gallerypages/ipix/noam/wmiss/zabptcaj.html looked like back in 2001.">http://travel.discovery.com/tools/gallerypages/ipix/noam/wmiss/zabptcaj.html</a>):</p>

                <p>Notice the use of <code class="nopad">&lt;!-- comment tags --></code> to help the web designer keep track of what she is doing and why.</p>
                <p>Notice that room has been made for the space used by the plug-in image file (280 x 210 pixels). If the layout for this web page had been initially created in Photoshop, the web designer would have left a 280 x 210 space in the layout itself and then replaced it with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> during the web-building phase. In all probability, this page was never individually designed in Photoshop but is simply one of many that share the same template.</p>
                <p>Notice that a Java applet has been used to embed the file, as described in this chapter’s section on Java. Visitors lacking the iPIX plug-in will be treated to a Java simulation, rather than simply encounter an error message about missing plug-ins.</p>
                <p>But what happens to the visitor whose browser does not support either plug-ins or Java? That is taken care of by the <code class="nopad">&lt;noembed></code> tags. Let’s look just at that section of the markup:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!--For MSIE 2 --><br>
                        &lt;noembed><br>
                        To view IPIX images you need to Upgrade your Browser. We recommend Version 3 or above of either Netscape or MSIE.&lt;br><br>
                        &lt;/noembed><br>
                        &lt;!-- end java applets --><br>
                        &lt;/p>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>The <code class="nopad">&lt;noembed></code> tag basically says, "Listen up, old, dumb browser. What follows is for you." In such a browser, the text beginning <span class="orange">To view IPIXimages…</span> will be revealed. In other browsers (those that support Java or contain the iPIX plug-in), the text message will be hidden.</p>
                <p>The designers also could have put this text and markup inside the <code class="nopad">&lt;applet></code> element, like so:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;applet name="IpixViewer" code="IpixViewer.class" archive="IpixViewer.jar" height="210" width="280"><br>
                        &lt;param name="URL" value="zabptcaj.ipx"><br>
                        &lt;param name="Spin" value="on"><br>
                        &lt;p>If you can read this, your browser does not support Java. Have a nice day.&lt;/p><br> 
                        &lt;/applet>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>As to whether anyone ever upgraded their browser in direct response to a website’s message, well, that is something else again.</p>
                <h3>The "Automagic Redirect"</h3>
                <p>Whether bundled with the browser or not, all plug-ins are readily available online. In some cases, when a web user hits a page that requires a plug-in not found on her system, Java is substituted for the missing plug-in (as in the preceding example).</p>
                <p>In most cases, though, Java is not pressed into service. After all, plug-in manufacturers want their plug-ins to be downloaded, not synthesized by a substitute technology. Typically, when a web user lacks a plug-in, she is "automagically" directed to the appropriate plug-in page so she can download it. In most cases, the magic is merely a matter of adding a <code class="nopad">&lt;pluginspage></code> attribute to the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code class="nopad">&lt;OBJECT></code> or <code class="nopad">&lt;EMBED></code> tag:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;embed src="http://build.kubrick.org/sounds/the.shinning/midnight.the.stars.and.you.mp3" autostart="true" volume="100" width="2" height="2" controls="hidden" pluginspage="http://www.quicktime.apple.com"></code></p>
                <p>In this snippet lifted from our unfinished experiment at <a href="//www.kubrick.org" title="Check out kubrick.org">www.kubrick.org</a>, the <code class="nopad">&lt;pluginspage></code> attribute to the <code class="nopad">&lt;EMBED></code> tag serves two functions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>The material in question is an <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> audio file (<span class="orange">midnight.the.stars.and.you.mp3</span>), capable of being played by a number of additional plug-ins and players, including RealPlayer, Flash, and a variety of free and commercial applications. Specifying QuickTime in the <code class="nopad">&lt;pluginspage></code> attribute tells the browser which plug-in to select: namely, Apple’s QuickTime plug-in. More about why that’s important a little later in this section.</span></li>
                    <li><span>It also provides a web address where the latest version of the Quick-Time plug-in can be downloaded. If the visitor did not have Quick-Time installed on her system, the browser would display a dialog box indicating that the plug-in was required and asking if she wished to download it. Clicking Yes or Okay would load the appropriate Apple plug-in page. The way the <code class="nopad">&lt;EMBED></code> tag works, the browser does most of the work of supporting the web user (and the web designer).</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Embed 'n Breakfast</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>
                        <code>&lt;embed src="http://build.kubrick.org/sounds/the.shinning/midnight.the.stars.and.you.mp3" autostart="true" volume="100" width="2" height="2" controls="hidden" pluginspage="http://www.quicktime.apple.com"></code>
                    </p>
                    <p>Heck, while we’ve got this markup in front of us, let’s just go ahead and explain what the rest of it means:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><code class="nopad">&lt;EMBED></code>. This tells the (2.0 or higher) browser to anticipate content that must be handled by a plug-in.</span></li>
                        <li><span><code class="nopad">&lt;AUTOSTART></code>. This tells the browser to begin playing the file instantly. (The default value is on.)</span></li>
                        <li><span><code class="nopad">&lt;VOLUME></code>. This sets the loudness. (The default value is 100, or full volume.)</span></li>
                        <li><span><code class="nopad">&lt;CONTROLS></code>. This specifies the presence or absence of on-screen controllers, similar to those on a video or audio cassette console. If controls are visible, they can be seen and used by the visitor. If hidden, they do not appear, and consequently they take up no space on the screen. (The default value is visible.) When would you use hidden? You’d use it, as we have here, when you simply want the file to play without prompting the visitor to do anything. Naturally, in such a case, you’ll turn Autostart on. Otherwise, you’re forcing the user to download a file they have no means of playing.</span></li>
                        <li><span><code class="nopad">&lt;WIDTH></code>, <code class="nopad">&lt;HEIGHT></code>. These attributes specify the size of an in-page controller, if any. Interesting paradox: If controls are hidden, why specify sizes at all? It’s because Netscape 2, 3, and 4 might crash if some size attribute were not included. It also could crash if the size were smaller than 2. As to the number itself, "2" means "2 pixels." Though width and height are specified, they do not appear because the <code class="nopad">"hidden"</code> value of the <code class="nopad">&lt;CONTROLS></code> attribute makes them invisible. If you’re working with hidden player controls, the default width and height attributes should be 2 to avoid crashing old versions of Netscape Navigator.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>Before we close this fascinating portion of our narrative, we must add one more reason to specify the player via the <code class="nopad">&lt;pluginspage></code> attribute: If you don’t, the browser will choose one for you, often with hideous results. Read on.</p>
                <h4>The iron-plated sound console from Hell</h4>
                <p>Right up through its 4.0 browser, Netscape used to respond to <abbr title="Waveform Audio File Format">WAV</abbr>, <abbr title="Audio Interchange File Format">AIFF</abbr>, AU, and other traditional sound file formats by sprouting an ugly little console. But the console did not simply leap up and start playing. Oh, no. Nor was the console actually part of Netscape’s browser, even though it was the default player. For reasons we can only guess at, Netscape chose Java as the foundation for the console.</p>
                <p>When you encountered a site that contained a sound, the page would stop loading, and the browser would seem to freeze. In the status bar, the dreaded words "Starting Java..." would appear. After a Vietnam-like eternity, the ugly console would at last pop up and blast the stupid sound.</p>
                <p>Now, suppose you did not feel like waiting for this mockery of a sham to run its course. Suppose you attempted to close the browser window or navigate to a previously visited site via the Back button. What would happen then? The browser would crash, of course.</p>
                <p>If most people did not detest embedded sound files to begin with, this tragicomic exercise in non-user-centric design certainly encouraged them to think of embedded sounds as one of Satan’s more diabolical efforts.</p>
                <h2>The Trouble With Plug-Ins</h2>
                <p>While providing the visitor with linkage to the appropriate plug-ins page is certainly a friendlier gesture than simply abandoning her to chance, most professionals try to go one step further. They try to hide all the technological complexity from their users. Even something as simple as navigating to a plug-ins page can confuse and frustrate some users.</p>
                <p>To work around this, most developers step in at this point and write a plug-in detection script. The theory is simple: If the user has the plug-in, the embedded content plays. If the user lacks the plug-in, some alternative is provided (perhaps something as simple as text). The user is never made to feel inadequate, never made aware that she might be missing something.</p>
                <p>It’s a beautiful plan, but as we mentioned in the JavaScript chapter, it has often broken down because plug-in detection is not universally supported.</p>
                <p>Netscape, having created JavaScript, has always used it in the browser to detect the presence or absence of plug-ins. Let’s take the Flash plug-in for argument’s sake. If the plug-in is not detected, the visitor might be taken to a page that explains that the site uses Flash and offers her the opportunity to download the plug-in from <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101050200/http://www.macromedia.com" title="Check out what macromedia.com looked like back in 2001.">Macromedia.com</a>, as previously described in "The ‘Automagic Redirect.'"</p>
                <p>Because JavaScript was not originally a standard technology, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer had to rely on another technique. Prior to <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5, Microsoft used <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>-only ActiveX technology to handle plug-in detection.</p>
                <p>Before writing plug-in detection scripts, developers had to write browser detection scripts. If the browser was Netscape’s, the JavaScript plug-in detection script ran. If the browser was <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>, ActiveX plug-in detection was triggered (and if the plug-in was missing, ActiveX would supply it).</p>
                <p>None of this worked on the Macintosh version of Explorer, whose users generally ended up in a hellish loop of nonfunctioning technology and self-contradictory error messages. This cruel stupidity should not be blamed on the Macintosh Operating System, nor on developers who toiled long and hard to work around browser deficiencies.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> now supports JavaScript on both the Windows and Macintosh platforms. As users upgrade to new versions of these browsers, these incompatibility problems should become a distant memory.</p>
                <p>Yet software developers still sometimes confuse Netscape’s proprietary JavaScript <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s with standard JavaScript. That’s why two plug-ins mentioned earlier in this chapter (Adobe’s <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> plug-in and Thomas Dolby’s Beatnik plug-in) don’t work properly with <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac.</p>
                <p>And web designers who don’t keep track of the ever-changing browser compatibility scene still make silly mistakes, particularly where <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac is concerned. For instance, even though <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac handles plug-in detection flawlessly, many Flash sites, when they detect the presence of <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> on a Mac, refuse to let the user proceed until she has switched to Netscape’s browser. This makes no sense, but it happens all the time.</p>
                <p>We fear we are beginning to lose some of you in the back row. Snap out of it. We’re almost done, honest.</p>
                <h3>If Plug-ins Run Free</h3>
                <p>Earlier we promised to answer a simple question: Why don’t companies that make plug-ins charge web users to download them? After all, Extensis makes a bundle from its fine Quark and Photoshop plug-ins. Are the makers of the most popular plug-ins (Macromedia, Apple, Real, and Microsoft) simply beautiful altruists who want to teach the world to sing and don’t desire a penny for their efforts?</p>
                <p>That was, of course, a rhetorical question.</p>
                <p>Companies distribute their plug-ins at no cost because the value of these products is commensurate with their distribution. Put simply, a plug-in that is on 100 million desktops is vastly more valuable than one that is on a million. How do you encourage a person to try something? Let them have it for free.</p>
                <p>Indeed, as we’ll see in a moment, companies not only gave stuff away free, they paid other companies to promote their free stuff. Never have so many spent so much to earn so little. (Excluding the browser wars themselves, of course. Those cost even more and made even less.)</p>
                <p>Okay, so as a result of giving all this good stuff away for free, Macromedia, Apple, Real, and Microsoft have achieved what they sought: nearly everybody uses their plug-ins. So how do these companies recoup their investment and hopefully even squeeze out a profit?</p>
                <p>They do it by creating and selling authoring tools. Web designers buy Macromedia Flash. Web producers buy Real Producer and professional QuickTime authoring suites.</p>
                <p>Though Apple sells professional QuickTime suites, it also gives away some extremely capable video authoring tools with every new Mac. What is the sense in that? The sense in that is that these "free" products come with a Macintosh. If you want the free product, you buy the Macintosh computer. Similarly, Microsoft gives away <abbr title="Windows Media File">WMF</abbr> authoring tools to encourage you to buy Windows products. Some web businesses might have trouble coming up with revenue models, but software and computer companies generally don’t.</p>
                <p>While striving to reach ubiquity, plug-in makers have frequently partnered with content producers. For instance, at different times, downloadable trailers at a well-known movie company’s empire of websites have been available exclusively in Apple’s QuickTime format, and at others, exclusively in Windows Media Player format. The plug-in maker compensated the movie studio for favoring its product over competitive plug-ins.</p>
                <p>Today the cash flows in the opposite direction. A movie studio might pay the purveyor of a popular plug-in to feature its studio instead of a competitive film conglomerate on the plug-in vendor’s "Hot Downloads" page. Ubiquity makes for destinations, and destinations, if popular enough, can generate income. To up the income, the plug-in page sprouts ad banners—from free plug-ins to cold cash in twelve easy lessons.</p>
                <p>As we feared, none of that was as interesting as Jennifer Lopez’s dress.</p>
                <h2>Parting Sermon</h2>
                <p>In <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, we discussed the way most popular plug-ins stream their presentations to compensate for slow user dialup modem speeds. We also reminded you just how slow those dialup speeds really are. Please reread <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a> before authoring high-bandwidth multimedia content or blithely adding it to a site for which it might be inappropriate.</p>
                <p>We web designers, most of us, anyway, live in a spoiled world of hyper-fast Internet access, powerful desktop processors, and wide-screen monitors. Most of the world does not enjoy such niceties, or anything half so nice.</p>
                <p>In fact, as the Web grows in popularity, the median average access speed declines drastically because there are more and more home users for every luxuriously appointed web professional. Though the field is expanding ten-fold, the web-using population is growing at many times that pace. Even if the profession were to stop growing, the number of web users would continue to rise.</p>
                <p>The day of universal high-speed access and fat bandwidth is not at hand. It’s not even close.</p>
                <p>While the prophets of high bandwidth high-five each other, millions in China and Africa and Alabama begin using the Web via a 14.4 modem that is shared by two or three families or 50 kids in a schoolroom. In libraries in America and around the world, those who cannot afford Internet access line up for hours to use public systems. Some of those systems are fast. Some are not. Few can afford to be tied up for hours just so some logo can spin.</p>
                <p>Even those on the fortunate side of the digital divide rarely enjoy the fastest speeds or the most reliable connections. When the <em>Daily Show’s</em> Jon Stewart jokes about the <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr> busy signal, the entire audience laughs. They’ve been there. Most of them still are there. They are not only Jon Stewart’s audience, they are every web designer’s audience. And they’re the ones in the good seats.</p>
                <p>So treat rich media like you’d treat Jim Beam: responsibly.</p>
