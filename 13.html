                <h1>Never Can Say Goodbye</h1>
                <p>YOUR DIALOG WITH THE WEB has now begun. And though this book, like young love, must end, our conversation will continue. You will find us, and we will find you on the pages of the World Wide Web.</p>
                <p>No book (indeed, no five-year program, if one existed) could teach you everything you need to know to design smart, attractive, user-focused websites. You will learn as you work—from teammates, partners, and even your clients.</p>
                <p>You also will learn a great deal from the people who visit your sites. You’ll be surprised at how many write—and not merely to complain when your single-spaced, 10<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> type sends them scurrying to the optometrist.</p>
                <p>But some of the best places to learn are on the Web itself, hence this chapter. In it we share our favorite online resources and explain the importance of continuing your education as the Web and your career experience growth and change.</p>
                <h2>Separation Anxiety</h2>
                <p>Throughout this book, we’ve shown methods used to design today’s Web and shared theories about how people interact with the medium. You need to know these things to begin working now.</p>
                <p>But as we’ve also pointed out, the Web is changing; indeed, like the sea, or like some other Zen metaphor we can’t quite put together here, the Web’s very nature is one of constant change. Currently the Web is changing in an intriguing way—one that will move it closer to its founders’ original vision of an open medium, accessible by all people and available to all sorts of Internet-enabled devices.</p>
                <p>What will empower that happy change? It will come with the separation of style from content. What does that mean? It means you’ll stop welding your texts and functions and images together through overextended <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Instead, you’ll keep your visual design in one place (a Cascading Style Sheet) and your content in another (a series of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> documents; a database of <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-formatted text). The twain will meet on the web page, but their behind-the-scenes separation will considerably enhance your working conditions and your audience’s experience.</p>
                <p>Instead of painstakingly slicing apart images in Photoshop as described in this book or spending hours hand-tweaking hundreds of individual <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents, you’ll have time to spend on more interesting pursuits such as design itself—which is, after all, what you do.</p>
                <p>This change in the nature of web design as a practice will come when all web users employ browsers that fully support the standards that empower us to separate style from content: <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, JavaScript/ <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, and the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.</p>
                <p>Not only do browsers have to change (and they are changing), web designers must also change—a proposition that requires the willingness to continue learning and to risk discarding methods we’ve spent years perfecting.</p>
                <p>In February 2001, <em>A List Apart</em> reinvented itself with a standards-compliant design that separates style from content (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010223150925/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/99" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/99 looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/stories/99/</a>). As you might expect, the site (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182141/http://www.alistapart.com" title="Check out what alistapart.com looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com</a>) is a good resource for information on that subject.</p>
                <p>The reinvention of <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> coincided with The Web Standards Project’s Browser Upgrade campaign (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010223215147/http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade" title="Check out what webstandards.org/upgrade looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webstandards.org/upgrade/</a>), which urges web designers to learn about and use the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommendations we’ve discussed in this book, even if the resulting sites look less than delicious in older, nonstandards-compliant browsers. The Browser Upgrade campaign also asks web designers and content creators to seek ways to encourage user upgrades so that the Web can improve without leaving anyone behind.</p>
                <p>The Browser Upgrade campaign and the <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> redesign were logical next steps in the evolution of the Web. We launched them while writing this book, which brings up the problem with books. Namely, while books have the virtue of permanence, they cannot update themselves as websites can. We encourage you to continue learning by visiting educational and inspiring websites and reading and participating in web design mailing lists and forums.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this chapter will provide you with plenty to choose from. Use these resources to amplify parts of this book and to learn more about the emerging, standards-based Web. At the end of the annotated list below, we’ll return to offer a final thought about the Web and you.</p>
                <h2>From Tag Soup to Talk Soup: Mailing Lists and Online Forums</h2>
                <p>Learning by trial and error is part of any process and is certainly part of web design. Learning from other members of your team is a deeply bonding experience, but learning (and sharing your own knowledge) on a mailing list is a pleasure no web designer should miss.</p>
                <p>There are many, many mailing lists and online communities for web designers and developers. Some focus on specific technologies; others are vast, crowded, and general. Some function as job referral services while others mainly promote the people who created the list. Some are chaotic, others restrictive. With a little effort, you will find the ones that make you feel most comfortable.</p>
                <p>Following, in alphabetical order, are some of our favorites.</p>
                <h3>A List Apart</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182141/http://www.alistapart.com" title="Check out what alistapart.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/</a></h4>
                <p>Each week <em>A List Apart</em> publishes useful tutorials ("Meet the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>," "Fear of Style Sheets"), challenging opinion pieces ("The Curse of Information Design," "Sympathy for the Plug-in"), or both. And each week, after reading these articles, <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> readers respond on the site’s discussion forum. The site is noncommercial, and you need not reveal your identity or other personal information to participate in the discussion forums.</p>
                <h3>Astounding Websites</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102031625/http://astoundingweb.org" title="Check out what astoundingweb.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.astoundingweb.org/</a></h4>
                <p>Launched by Glenn Davis and maintained by Dave Bastian, this unique discussion community was created to honor the best writing, design, and programming on the Web. Visit this small, friendly forum to discover inspiring commercial and noncommercial sites or participate by reviewing sites you admire. You can also submit your own sites for review in the Site Promotion section.</p>
                <h3>The Babble List</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010220162218/http://www.babblelist.com" title="Check out what babblelist.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.babblelist.com/</a></h4>
                <p>Maintained by Christopher Schmitt (and resurrected by him in 2001 after a brief hiatus), The Babble List is a well-run general web design mailing list, covering issues of graphic design, information architecture, writing, usability, project management, and related skills. Though the average Babble Lister is a professional with at least two years’ experience, the list is beginner-friendly. If you find yourself stuck on a JavaScript or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> problem or wondering why your site looks great in one browser but poor in another, you can post your message to The Babble List and anticipate useful feedback.</p>
                <h3>Dreamless</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191036/http://www.dreamless.org" title="Check out what dreamless.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.dreamless.org/</a></h4>
                <p>Dreamless is a deep and open community primarily populated by young graphic designers and Flash artists. Though the site’s gray-on-gray, Arial-only design gives it a somber appearance, it’s anything but dull. Dreamless discussions range from the seriously spiritual to the deliberately silly. The site has a fanatical following and encourages its members to get together at parties in various cities. If you have trouble finding the site’s front door, use View Source.</p>
                <h3>Evolt</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/20000304003841/http://www.evolt.org" title="Check out what evolt.org looked like back in 2000.">http://www.evolt.org/</a></h4>
                <p>Evolt, a multi-faceted mailing list, online message board, and member-created publication, provides useful dialog spaces for technically minded web designers and developers worldwide. Accessibility and web standards are hot topics here, and you can learn simply by reading other members’ posts. Like all communities mentioned here, Evolt is self-policing; and like all successful communities, it manages the task unobtrusively.</p>
                <h3>Metafilter</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182340/http://www.metafilter.com" title="Check out what metafilter.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.metafilter.com/</a></h4>
                <p>Matt Haughey’s noncommercial community site is not about web design or web programming, but many web content creators will be found in its forums. Billing itself as a "community weblog," the occasionally raucous discussion site can help you get a handle on aspects of the Web’s emerging culture. This in turn will remind you that the Web is not about <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags or graphic design; like Soylent Green, the Web is people.</p>
                <h3>Redcricket</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191813/http://www.redcricket.com" title="Check out what redcricket.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.redcricket.com/</a></h4>
                <p>Dan Beauchamp’s personal site includes a web design forum ("Community") that’s small, lively, and friendly. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> questions? JavaScript woes? Redcricket could be the ticket. By maintaining a fairly low profile, Redcricket’s forum generally avoids the flame wars and ego trips that sometimes plague other lists and communities. Spend time at the site before you post. Redcricket is a tight community of friends; barging in and loudly demanding attention won’t go over well.</p>
                <h3>Webdesign-l</h3>
                <h4><a href="//webdesign-l.com" title="Check out webdesign-l.com.">http://webdesign-l.com/</a></h4>
                <p>Stewarded by Steven Champeon, Webdesign-l is a long-running, smartly focused design and development list. Some of the brightest people in the industry participate in this highly respected list. Champeon, a systems guru who technical-edited <em>Taking Your Talent to the Web</em> and who co-founded The Web Standards Project, runs a tight ship. As list administrator, he keeps misinformation to a minimum and stops bad behavior before it starts. Beginner questions might be well-received if submitted with restraint. ("Hellllllp! My site is hosed!!!!!!" will probably not generate the kind of feedback you want.) Read the list rules and get used to the general discussion tone before posting to the list.</p>
                <h3>When All Else Fails</h3>
                <h4><a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101241012/http://www.r35.com/edu" title="Check out what r35.com/edu looked like back in 2001.">http://www.r35.com/edu/</a></h4>
                <p>Consider a class. R35edu offers a curriculum of over 60 courses, covering nearly every facet of web strategy, design, development, commerce, and marketing—all via "a unique distance learning environment that puts you in direct contact with creative innovators and designers from all over the world."</p>
                <h2>Eye and Brain Candy: Educational and Inspiring Sites</h2>
                <p>Attempting to figure out web design exclusively from a book is like trying to learn about music without listening to any. Fortunately, the Web is rich in inspiring and educational sites. Following are a few of our favorites, including a couple of our own (cough).</p>
                <h3>Design, Programming, Content</h3>
                <p><em>A List Apart</em> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182141/http://www.alistapart.com" title="Check out what alistapart.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.alistapart.com/</a>), "for people who make websites. From pixels to prose, coding to content." See previous section for more on this.</p>
                <p>Apple Internet Developer (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240514/http://developer.apple.com/internet" title="Check out what developer.apple.com/internet looked like back in 2001.">http://developer.apple.com/internet/</a>), launched in 2001, started small, but what it has is choice: brief and pungent tutorials on <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, online typography, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript, and the <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>.</p>
                <p>Builder (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010322042737/http://builder.cnet.com/webbuilding/0-3880.html?" title="Check out what builder.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.builder.com/</a>), "solutions for site builders," provides articles and tutorials on graphic design, multimedia, back-end development, and even software ("Fireworks vs. ImageReady"). There is also a discussion board (Builder Buzz), and the site hosts a dandy annual web design conference in New Orleans.</p>
                <p>Each month, Digital Web (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102021505/http://www.digital-web.com" title="Check out what digital-web.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.digital-web.com/</a>), "the web designer’s online magazine of choice," brings you fresh interviews, tutorials, columns, and even classifieds (to help you get your next job). Edited and published by Nick Finck, who also contributes to <em>A List Apart</em>.</p>
                <p>Web Page Design for Designers (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010405045240/http://www.wpdfd.com" title="Check out what wpdfd.com looked like back in 2001.">http://wpdfd.com/</a>), published monthly by Joe Gillespie, is "aimed at people...already involved with design and typography for conventional print, [who] want to explore the possibilities of this new electronic medium." In other words, it speaks to the audience of this very book! (We would have titled this book "Web Design for Designers" if Joe hadn’t beaten us to the punch, darn him.) The site includes typefaces optimized for the Web, columns on web design and typography, and a solid listing of third-party resources.</p>
                <p>The Web Standards Project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050037/http://webstandards.org" title="Check out what webstandards.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webstandards.org/</a>), co-founded by Glenn Davis, George Olsen, and your humble author, maintains a Resources section for your educational pleasure. Confused about <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, and the rest of the alphabet soup? You’ll find links to relevant articles here.</p>
                <p>Web Techniques (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101161259/http://www.webtechniques.com/?" title="Check out what webtechniques.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webtechniques.com/</a>) is a vast, professional publication with an accompanying real-world magazine you can read in the bathtub or carry in your attache case. It covers web technology and business and can help you understand how wireless technology interfaces with web design.</p>
                <p>Web Review (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020637/http://webreview.com" title="Check out what webreview.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webreview.com/</a>) publishes some of the smartest tutorials we’ve ever seen on <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and other web technologies and has always been a great friend to web standards. Highly recommended, particularly for those who wish to understand web technologies instead of simply pushing buttons in <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors.</p>
                <p>Think of Webmonkey (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010208104923/http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey" title="Check out what webmonkey.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webmonkey.com/</a>), originally directed by Jeff "Art & Science of Web Design" Veen, as Builder.com with more attitude. A deep resource dating back to the earliest days of the designed Web, the site sports swell tutorials on <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and other technologies, along with columns and articles on streaming media, emerging standards, and the web business. Not updated as often as it used to be, but still a fine smoke.</p>
                <p>Webreference (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101032349/http://www.webreference.com" title="Check out what webreference.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webreference.com/</a>), a subsidiary of Internet.com (yes, there really is an Internet.com), is tailored more to developers than designers but will repay your exploration. Edited by Andy King, the vast site covers everything you could ever want to know on the web technology front. Interviews and discussion forums enhance the site’s value.</p>
                <p>Webtype (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102021257/http://www.webtype.org" title="Check out what webtype.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webtype.org/</a>), dedicated to better online typography, keeps you posted on this vital and sadly under-reported topic. (Sometimes web designers seem more interested in scripting and gimmicks than they are in ensuring that type is legible—let alone attractive and pleasurable to read.) Webtype gives you the lowdown on everything from readability studies and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> nuances to typographic explorations and downloadable typefaces. Don’t miss the survey of fonts installed on <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> and Mac users’ computers. Founded by the mysterious "Gen," with kibitzing from Dave Bastian, Joe Clark, Julia Hayden, Webmistress Jo, and your humble author.</p>
                <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101042035/http://www.w3.org" title="Check out what w3.org looked like back in 2001.">http://w3.org/</a>), the mother of us all, is the final authority on web standards. Use it to keep track of existing and emerging technologies and to verify the way these technologies should work, before running off half-cocked, screaming about aliens jamming the radio transmitter embedded in your skull as part of an evil <abbr title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</abbr> experiment. Note that <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> articles, while definitive, are among the least easy to read and understand of any we’ve seen—and that includes <abbr title="Video Cassette Recorder">VCR</abbr> manuals written in Japan. You’ll do better if you check <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> to see what you should learn about; then read the friendly tutorials at Webmonkey, Builder, or <em>A List Apart</em>.</p>
                <h3>The Big Kahunas</h3>
                <p>Let us now praise famous art directors:</p>
                <p>Adobe (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040105/http://www.adobe.com" title="Check out what adobe.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.adobe.com/</a>) not only makes great software for print and web designers, they also run a fine, vast site full of tutorials, columns, and articles on web, print, and motion design. Disclaimer: Your humble author writes a column for this publication.</p>
                <p><abbr title="American institute of Graphic Arts">AIGA</abbr> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010302123110/http://www.aiga.org" title="Check out what aiga.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.aiga.org/</a>), the American institute of Graphic Arts, has a long and noble history as a membership organization for designers. But you know that. The site helps you track seminars and conferences and offers a national job bank and member discussion board along with thought-provoking articles ("What is Graphic Design?").</p>
                <p>Communication Arts (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182116/http://www.commarts.com" title="Check out what commarts.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.commarts.com/</a>) is among the world’s most-respected voices for design. Its interactive section includes design technology columns and a Website of the Week. And of course the Communication Arts annuals honor some of the best design and advertising communications in the world.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Photo District News">PDN</abbr>-Pix (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240510/http://pdn-pix.com/pix" title="Check out what pdn-pix.com/pix looked like back in 2001.">http://www.pdn-pix.com/pix/</a>), the digital arm of Photo District News, provides web design features ("Waiting to Load"), Q&amp;A ("Ask Pix"), reviews of noteworthy sites ("Pix’s e-Projects"), and a column by your humble author ("Second Site"). The print magazine will repay your interest; much of this material gets republished on the site along with some web-only content ("Grand Masters of Flash").</p>
                <h3>Beauty and Inspiration</h3>
                <p>When grinding out menu bar buttons saps your inspiration, trust well-designed, meaningful sites to restore it. Begin your voyage with sites that deliver compelling, original content (and not in plain brown wrappers):</p>
                <p>{fray} (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102010900/http://fray.com" title="Check out what fray.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.fray.com/</a>), the ultimate personal storytelling site, was conceived, produced, and art-directed by designer/author Derek Powazek. In addition to showcasing what an imaginative web designer can do with words and pictures, the site functions as an on and offline community. Highly recommended. (Derek Powazek is also the author of <em>Design For Community</em>, published by New Riders.)</p>
                <p>Glassdog (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182010/http://glassdog.com" title="Check out what glassdog.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.glassdog.com/</a>), Lance Arthur’s personal magnum opus, is both sarcastic and smooth. As if the site’s clever writing and smart scripting were not intimidating enough, Arthur manages to combine clean, spare, easy-to-navigate design with the technical dexterity of a dazzling showoff.</p>
                <p>Harrumph! (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101190001/http://www.harrumph.com" title="Check out what harrumph.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.harrumph.com/</a>), Heather Champ’s charming and witty online diary, sports one of the cleanest web layouts we know. Perhaps this is because Heather has been designing websites since 1995, or perhaps it’s because she’s got taste. All we know is, every site that uses words should be this easy to read and engaging to look at. Few are.</p>
                <p>Media.org (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010309062005/http://media.org" title="Check out what media.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.media.org/</a>), "a collective of artists/architects... fueled by a passion for the Internet medium," was cofounded by Carl Malamud and Webchick in 2000 to debunk web inanities, promote web intelligence, and rescue digital works laid waste by careless businesses. Among the sites they rescued:</p>
                <p>Mappa Mundi (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020640/http://mappa.mundi.net" title="Check out what mappa.mundi.net looked like back in 2001.">http://www.mappa.mundi.net/</a>) a smart, monthly web-only magazine and another Malamud/Webchick production, is perhaps the most intellectual of the noncommercial online ‘zines.</p>
                <p>Spark Online (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010405011104/http://www.spark-online.com" title="Check out what spark-online.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.spark-online.com/</a>) is an extremely ambitious monthly online magazine covering media, trends, and society. Like all the others mentioned here, it is essentially a nonprofit labor of love.</p>
                <p>The preceding sites show what can be done when original minds combine fresh content with fine style.</p>
                <p>Those directly following show what can be accomplished when innovation and skillful graphic design are combined. Indeed, most of the following sites exist solely for that purpose, though a few are also commercial in nature.</p>
                <p>Many of the sites listed require Flash and QuickTime, and it helps to have a recent browser and a fast connection.</p>
                <p>Amon Tobin Supermodified (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010405110552/http://www.amontobin.com" title="Check out what amontobin.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.amontobin.com/</a>), previously mentioned in these pages, is an extraordinary music site created in Flash. A cold, high-tech look, with a warmly interactive embrace, the site will reward your patience.</p>
                <p>Archinect (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010301203925/http://www.archinect.com" title="Check out what archinect.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.archinect.com/</a>), an ever-changing visual exploration, should be seen and not described.</p>
                <p>Assembler (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020337/http://assembler.org" title="Check out what assembler.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.assembler.org/</a>), Brent Gustaffson’s masterpiece of cross-browser <abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr> programming has a lovely and understated design sensibility.</p>
                <p>Born Magazine (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010301205314/http://www.bornmagazine.com" title="Check out what bornmagazine.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.bornmagazine.com/</a>) is a long-running, ambitious, collaborative work that attempts to continually reinvent the conjunction between word and image. The noncommercial site’s tagline is "Design. Literature. Together."</p>
                <p>Egomedia (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102012030/http://www.egomedia.com" title="Check out what egomedia.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.egomedia.com/</a>) is a design company portfolio with the sensibility of a rock video. Requires Flash.</p>
                <p>Lushly designed eneri.net (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191040/http://www.eneri.net" title="Check out what eneri.net looked like back in 2001.">http://www.eneri.net/</a>) makes no bones about narrowing its audience: "This site targets luxurious people with a fast computer, fast Internet connection, Netscape or <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 4.0 or above, and Shockwave 7 plug-in." For those who meet the requirements, Irene Chan’s labor of love offers a beautiful, film-like experience.</p>
                <p>Entropy 8 Zuper (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191051/http://entropy8zuper.org" title="Check out what entropy8zuper.org looked like back in 2001.">http://entropy8zuper.org/</a>) is the site of Auriea Harvey, one of the first web designers to laugh at conventions and bust boundaries. Requires "fast computer, <abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr> browser, Flash 5 or better" and "a physical need for wonder and poetry."</p>
                <p>Futurefarmers (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101072052/http://futurefarmers.com" title="Check out what futurefarmers.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.futurefarmers.com/</a>), Amy Franceschini’s web and multimedia design company, gives the lie to the notion that corporate work must be staid and conservative. Amy is one of the original exponents of fine design on the Web; her early web work is housed permanently at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.</p>
                <p>Gmunk (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102021549/http://www.gmunk.com" title="Check out what gmunk.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.gmunk.com/</a>), a high-density personal site, pushes the envelope every which way. Outrageously high bandwidth, QuickTime movies, layered Photoshop collages rendered in Flash: everything usability experts rail against is practiced here, by a master who can get away with it. Tune in after losing an argument with your information designer or your client.</p>
                <p>Interiors (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010429053903/http://www.webproductions.com/photo" title="Check out what webproductions.com/photo looked like back in 2001.">http://www.webproductions.com/photo/</a>) is a dynamic slideshow of digital self-portraits by artist Steve Giovinco. To call the work "disturbing" would be an understatement. It’s also quite powerful.</p>
                <p>Monocrafts (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191343/http://www.yugop.com" title="Check out what yugop.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.yugop.com/</a>) combines powerful visual content with unbelievably innovative interface ideas—extremely inspiring.</p>
                <p>One9ine (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010330081433/http://www.one9ine.com/flash.html" title="Check out what one9ine.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.one9ine.com/</a>), a web design agency created by designers, not marketers, is gorgeously rich yet entirely functional and easy to navigate. Think the two can’t coexist? Look and see.</p>
                <p>Once Upon A Forest (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010404233257/http://www.once-upon-a-forest.com" title="Check out what once-upon-a-forest.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.once-upon-a-forest.com/</a>) is an abstract, deliberately cryptic work of genius by Joshua Davis, who also brings us Praystation and Dreamless.</p>
                <p>S.M. Moalie’s Photomontage (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102010556/http://photomontage.com" title="Check out what photomontage.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.photomontage.com/</a>) makes us cry. ‘Nuff said.</p>
                <p>Marc Klein’s Pixel Industries (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010401151253/http://www3.pixel-industries.com" title="Check out what pixel-industries.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.pixel-industries.com/</a>), well known and widely imitated, is a textbook example of the graphic-design-lead approach to web development. See also Marc’s Creative Republic (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020530/http://www.creative-republic.com" title="Check out what creative-republic.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.creative-republic.com/</a>).</p>

                <p>Praystation (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182222/http://www.praystation.com" title="Check out what praystation.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.praystation.com/</a>), Joshua Davis’s site, is dedicated to exploring and enlarging the boundaries of Flash and interface design. If you are learning Flash and beginning to think you know what it can and can’t do, check Praystation. Davis gives away his source code so others can use it in their design projects.</p>
                <p>Presstube (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102012015/http://presstube.com" title="Check out what presstube.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.presstube.com/</a>), James Patterson’s personal illustration portfolio, reveals mastery of Flash as well as considerable drawing skill.</p>

The playful and well-crafted interface makes great use of frames and scripting, and the color combinations are uniquely dramatic and pleasing.</p>
                <p>Josh Ulm’s collaborative Remedi Project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182159/http://www.theremediproject.com" title="Check out what theremediproject.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.theremediproject.com/</a>) is a bleeding-edge leading light. Requires a modern browser, a fistful of plug-ins, and a fast connection (or great patience).</p>
                <p>Mike Cina’s Trueistrue (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102010642/http://trueistrue.com" title="Check out what trueistrue.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.trueistrue.com/</a>) is a completely unique, ever-changing, strangely minimalist exploration of line and form.</p>
                <p>Volumeone (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102040059/http://volumeone.com/00winter/index.html" title="Check out what volumeone.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.volumeone.com/</a>) is Matt Owens’s masterpiece. Updated quarterly, the site explores abstract visual issues through Flash and Photoshop.</p>
                <p>Yenz: The Secret Garden of Mutabor (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182041/http://www.yenz.com" title="Check out what yenz.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.yenz.com/</a>) is a navigable space of large, striking images that load quickly because they are entirely vector-based. Created in Illustrator, Freehand, and Flash 3, the site guides you through one rich image field after another. The effect is both mesmerizing and soothing.</p>
                <p>ZX26 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182233/http://www.zx26.com" title="Check out what zx26.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.zx26.com/</a>) is a noncommercial Japanese font site, built entirely with tiny animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Still hungry? The following design community sites showcase some of the newest and funkiest work being done anywhere. In addition, most are lovingly designed and cunningly programmed.</p>
                <p>Design is Kinky (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182031/http://www.designiskinky.net" title="Check out what designiskinky.net looked like back in 2001.">http://www.designiskinky.net/</a>), created by Aussies Andrew Johnstone and Jade Palmer, features designer mug shots and hosts interviews with the likes of David Carson (not that there are really any likes of David Carson). For similar material, see Australia In Front (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182033/http://www.australianinfront.com.au" title="Check out what australianinfront.com.au looked like back in 2001.">http://www.australianinfront.com.au/</a>).</p>
                <p>Kaliber 10000 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102031452/http://www.k10k.net/issue100celebration/12/index.htm" title="Check out what k10k.net looked like back in 2001.">http://www.k10k.net/</a>), created by Danish lads Michael Schmidt and Token Nygaard, publishes a special new design project every week and is a superbly designed site in its own right—as you probably gathered from the many times we’ve mentioned in this book.</p>
                <p>Netdiver Net (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182356/http://www.netdiver.net" title="Check out what netdiver.net looke like back in 2001.">http://www.netdiver.net/</a>) feeds your eyes with links and your brain with close-up interviews. Got a great site? Netdiver might review it if it meets "chief imagineer" Carole Guevin’s criteria: The ‘diver seeks impeccable content as well as superb design.</p>
                <p>Japan-based Shift (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010301173708/http://www.shift.jp.org" title="Check out what shift.jp.org looked like back in 2001.">http://www.shift.jp.org/</a>) , the mother of all design portals, has inspired most of the sites in this section. In addition to its online presence, the site generates real-world design products such as the Gas-book series and the IMG SRC 100 book.</p>
                <p>Straight outta Luxembourg, Surfstation (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020154/http://www.surfstation.lu" title="Check out what surfstation.lu looked like back in 2001.">http://www.surfstation.lu/</a>) currently features the tiniest type on the Web. Fortunately the site’s design news, interviews, and playful collaborative sections are easy and delightful to read.</p>
                <p>Three.oh Inspirational Kingdom (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010419143446/http://www.threeoh.com" title="Check out what threeoh.com looked like back in 2001.">http://www.threeoh.com/</a>) brags precision design and special interactive features, as well as advanced and super-funky JavaScript tricks. (For instance, loading an interview or special design feature in a pop-up window causes the original window to be "grayed out" by means of a full-screen layer swap.)</p>
                <p>Special mentions:</p>
                <p>Joe Jenett’s Coolstop (<a href="//www.coolstop.com/v4.5" title="Check out coolstop.com/v4.5/.">http://www.coolstop.com/v4.5/</a>) was an independent portal to fine design and original content long before there was even a category for such sites, and continues to fulfill its mission with clarity, focus, and integrity. Its spiritual predecessor was Glenn Davis and Teresa Martin’s Project Cool, still operational, but not the same since its founders departed.</p>
                <p>Notice that nearly every site mentioned is a noncommercial, independent site. Coincidence? Read the Time Life Books.</p>
                <p>Believe us when we tell you that the sites listed above are not even a fraction of one percent of the best such sites out there. And there is always room for more, which brings us to our valedictory address:</p>
                <h2>The Independent Content Producer Refuses to Die!</h2>
                <p>This book is written for professionals in a competitive market. Consequently, we’ve spent most of our time talking about job skills—present and future. But designers do not live by bread alone—not even when it’s <em>really good</em> bread.</p>
                <p>We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: If the Web is fascinating simply as a medium rife with challenges and rich in possibilities, it is even more alluring when you consider its low barrier to entry. This medium does not merely <em>permit</em> you to publish your own work, it begs for it.</p>
                <p>From a purely selfish point of view, most of today’s best-known web designers are famous for their personal sites, not for their commercial projects (though these are of course viewed and respected). Fame may seem a silly thing to seek, but it sure doesn’t hurt when you’re looking for your next job or your next client or approaching a backer to start your own agency.</p>
                <p>The real jazz cats might do studio gigs to put three squares on the table, but dawn always caught them blowing mad bop in crazy uptown clubs. Real web designers jam after hours too—on personal and collaborative content and design sites, online magazines, and experimental spaces.</p>
                <p>By creating and maintaining sites that cannot be controlled, compromised, disfigured, or deleted by the indifference or poor judgement of clients or managers, you will always have good work to show for yourself. More importantly, you have the chance to express yourself—to find out what you’re made of when no client is paying you and to find out what you really want to say.</p>
                <p>If you were a classical composer, you’d have to pay a symphony orchestra just to hear your own music. And if you were a filmmaker, forget about it. But in independent web production, the only questionable part of your budget is how much time you can afford.</p>
                <p>No one is in control of this space. No one can tell you how to design it, how much to design it, when to "dial it down." No one will hold your hand and structure it for you. No one will create the content for you. What is in you? What thwarted creative potential is burning to get out, grow, and find its audience?</p>
                <p>If you do this well, it will reflect back into the work you do for clients. Not only will this help your career, it will also enrich your life and the lives of others. Creating your content, designing it your way, repositioning yourself from vendor to author, you will have made your mark on the medium and perhaps on your generation.</p>
                <p>You will have taken your talent to the Web.</p>
