                <h4>chapter 2</h4>
                <h1>Designing for the Medium</h1>
                <p>THE WEB IS LIKE EVERY OTHER MEDIUM to which you’ve applied your talents and like no other medium you’ve ever grappled with. Everything you know as a designer will help you tremendously, yet nearly everything you know must be rethought. Sounds like a sales pitch—until you’ve actually tried your hand at web design.</p>
                <p>The Web is different because websites must function as both documents and databases. It’s different again because the medium is somewhat ephemeral in nature, never looking or functioning exactly the same way for each person who encounters it. Prove this to yourself by visiting any sophisticated site using <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 on an iMac, Netscape 6 in Linux, and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>4 on a Windows <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>. If it looks and works exactly the same in all three settings, we’ll eat our Aunt Miriam’s crepe de chine hat. And these are just three of thousands of possible combinations.</p>
                <p>The Web is both more and less capable than print. On the one hand, it provides near-instant access to information, offers rich multimedia experiences, and responds dynamically to the visitor’s actions. On the other, it defeats the designer’s desire to completely control the visual experience.</p>
                <p>The Web is different because anybody can make a website, but not everybody can do it well.</p>
                <p>Finally, the Web is different because it works best when it’s lean and mean. Looking at a full-bleed, two-page spread places no strain on magazine readers, but viewing sites that make extensive use of images, sounds, and other "heavy" media can put a serious crimp in the web user’s experience—particularly if the designer has not taken pains to optimize the site. File sizes must be kept small if web pages are to download quickly and efficiently over slow, dialup modem connections (or even fast connections). Include too many images or other files per page, and the fastest connection will slow to a crawl due to limitations in the number of files that can be served simultaneously.</p>
                <p>This conflict between size and speed is known as bandwidth, and we will have much to say about it later in this chapter. For now, the following disturbingly technical definition will either give you your bearings or send you screaming back to the safety of print design.</p>
                <h6>A Definition of Bandwidth</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>According to Whatis.com (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200011090718/http://www.whatis.com" title="Check out what whatis.com looked like in 2000.">www.whatis.com</a>):</p>
                    <p>"Bandwidth (the width of a band of electromagnetic frequencies) is used to mean... how fast data flows on a given transmission path.... It takes more bandwidth to download a photograph in one second than it takes to download a page of text in one second. Large sound files, computer programs, and animated videos require still more bandwidth for acceptable system performance."</p>
                </div>
                <p>Designing for the medium is a joy—once you understand the Web’s limitations and opportunities.</p>
                <h2>Breath Mint? Or Candy Mint?</h2>
                <p>If you know your web history (or if you’ve skipped ahead to <a href="5.html" title="Check out chapter 5.">Chapter 5</a>, "The Obligatory Glossary"), you’ll recall that the Web was conceived as an open platform for distributing structured text documents. When physicists Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Caillou created Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) as a limited subset of a much more complex open standard for document publishing, graphic design was the last thing on their minds.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was as simple as rain. It was built in that way so scientists could learn it quickly and use it to publish their physics papers online. Documents published in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> were "styled" by the default settings of early Web browsers (the familiar Times New Roman on a gray background). Early web pages looked exactly like physics papers, which was pretty darned great if you were a physicist.</p>
                <p>But clients don’t buy physics papers. After designers and their clients grasped the Web’s commercial potential, they began seeking ways to make web pages look as good as other professional publications. Today, web standards such as Cascading Style Sheets <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> allow us to do just that. But in 1994 and 1995, these standards did not exist, so web designers and browser makers such as Netscape began "extending" the behavior of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in nonstandard ways.</p>
                <p>What happened to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was not unlike what happens to legislation introduced in the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> Congress. A legislator wants to change the speed limit in his home state. By the time it gets out of committee, the bill includes taxes on liquor and tobacco, gun licensing restrictions, subsidies for farmers, mandatory parental warnings on <abbr title="Compact Discs">CDs</abbr> and cassettes, and an impassioned plea for school prayer. Over the years, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was similarly amended, extended, and tacked onto by a thousand hands. Many of those amendments were intended to facilitate the needs of designers. A few were just plain wacky. We’ve been coping with the damage ever since. Take the following example:</p>
                <p><em><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in the "Good Old Days":</em></p>
                <p><code>&lt;a href="index.html">&lt;IMG SRC="image.gif" alt="Return to the home page.">&lt;/a></code></p>
                <p><em><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Today</em></p>
                <p><code>&lt;tr>&lt;td valign="top">&lt;a HREF="index.html" target="elchico" onMouseOver="window.status=’Home again, home again, jiggity jig.’; changeImages(‘toc’, ‘omen2/coreover.gif’); return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=’’; changeImages(‘toc’, ‘omen2/core.gif’); return true;">&lt;img name="toc" src="omen2/core.gif" width="49" height="25" border="0" alt="Return to the core page." Title="Home again, home again, jiggity jig.">&lt;/a>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr></code></p>
                <p>Later in this chapter, we’ll talk about <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and web standards in more detail. For now, it’s important to realize that the impulse behind the Web’s creation was logical, structured, and intended to address a basic need: the simple sharing of data. It was never about marketing or design.</p>
                <p>Despite all that has befallen since those early days, many people continue to view the Web as an archive or database of searchable information. And some of these folks have espoused a set of "rules" to ensure that web pages yield their information with a minimum of fuss and confusion. Let’s call this group the <em>Usability People</em>. Jakob Nielsen is one of their foremost exponents, and you can read what he has to say at <a href="//www.useit.com" title="Check out useit.com. Or don't. Whatever.">www.useit.com</a>. To Usability fans, anything that impedes access to the data is bad; anything that momentarily confuses even a single user is bad; and thus, pretty much anything out of the ordinary is viewed with suspicion or banned outright. This view of the Web is straightforward and can serve as a touchstone for web designers, though the guidelines espoused by Usability gurus should not be confused with Commandments. (Last time we checked, the Commandments were written by Someone else.)</p>
                <p>Usability basically reminds designers to think about the needs of their audience. On many commercial and informational sites, web users simply hope to find things or do things as quickly as possible. When checking sports scores or seeking low airfares, they do not wish to be creatively challenged by a complex multimedia experience. They merely want to find what they seek and get on with their lives.</p>
                <p>This does not mean that web design is a cold, calculating science. Far from it: Like all good design, web design is aesthetic, emotional, and largely unquantifiable. The value in the Usability perspective is that it reminds web designers to create sites that people can actually use.</p>
                <p>This ought to go without saying, but you’ll find that in web design almost nothing goes without saying. Perhaps in print you’ve known designers who become so carried away with graphic design for its own sake that they forget to communicate. The synergy between headline and visual gets lost in a haze of technique; typography advances toward illegibility; subtleties of lighting completely obscure the subject, and so on. When web designers make the same mistake, potential readers and customers are thwarted in their desire to use the site. The folks in suits start beating the designers over the head with Jakob Nielsen’s latest book, and a good time is had by no one. Don’t let this happen to you. It’s easy to avoid if you keep the intended user and usages in mind.</p>
                <p>Magazine and ad layouts may be wild or restrained as long as they are legible. Web design must be much more than legible, though many sites fail to achieve even basic readability, and few indeed are a pleasure to read. (To say nothing of the fact that most ad layouts are intended to convey simple messages, while websites often perform numerous, complex functions.) In his widely read 1996 treatise, <em>Creating Killer Websites</em>, David Siegel listed three cardinal virtues of web design: "Clarity, Brevity, Bandwidth." Though Siegel was a graphic designer and not a Usability Person (and though he did not always achieve these goals in his own work), there’s likely not a Usability Person on the planet who would disapprove of that trinity.</p>
                <p>But many designers and artists saw something quite different in the Web: the chance to create and publish creative works that plunge the viewer into a unique world of imagery, exploration, and cinematic or personal narrative. This view, implicit in sites such as Photomontage (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102010556/http://photomontage.com" title="Check out what photomontage.com looked like back in 2000.">www.photomontage.com</a>) and Presstube (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010419195055/http://www.presstube.com" title="Check out what presstube.com looked like back in 2001.">www.presstube.com</a>), is as vital to the health of the medium as the contrasting Usability perspective. We’ll call its exponents the web artists, though this label is somewhat misleading. For while it’s true that many web artists are motivated by the urge toward pure creative expression, the trails they blaze are invariably followed by marketers in search of deep online branding opportunities. The innovations delivered by pioneering multimedia artists quickly become the basis for sites touting Motown, Madonna, or Barney’s New York.</p>
                <p>Web artists do not believe in holding the visitor’s hand. They judge that websites can be as challenging as paintings, music, literature, or Swedish movies. They further hold that there is an audience for sites that raise bars and test boundaries. They are, of course, correct. Challenging sites can reward patient viewers. They don’t please everyone but neither does modern painting. Writer Curt Cloninger summed up the conflict between those who view the Web as an informational database and those who see it as a wide-open aesthetic frontier when he shrugged, "Usability Experts are from Mars, Graphic Designers are from Venus" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20000816004010/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/marsvenus" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/marsvenus/ looked like back in 2000.">www.alistapart.com/stories/marsvenus/</a>).</p>

                        <p>Supermodified looks like (and is) a work of multimedia art. Yet it serves a commercial purpose. Visitors can trigger loops of music by typing on the keyboard. A strictly informational approach to site design, such as the Google Search Engine (Figure 2.2), would be far less effective at creating excitement about the composer’s work (<a href="//www.amontobin.com" title="Check out amontobin.com.">www.amontobin.com</a>).</p>

                        <p>The Google Search Engine. A classic example of function driving form (with the possible exception of the logo). Google’s search engine delivers solid results, and hardcore geeks love it because it strips away the clots that clog the arteries of most commercial search engines. Both Google and <a href="//www.amontobin.com" title="Check out what amontobin.com looked like back in 2001.">amontobin.com</a> are successful at doing what they set out to do, yet they are clearly different in their approach to the user experience (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182144/http://www.google.com" title="Check out what google.com looked like back in 2001.">www.google.com</a>).</p>

                <p class="clearfix">Mars and Venus, left and right brain, utility and artistry. On one side stands a set of Usability Commandments based on roughly a decade of trial and error and a heaping teaspoon of pseudo-science. On the other lies the indefinable essence of art and a horde of marketers who stand ready to exploit it.</p>
                <p>Somewhere between these two extremes you will find the appropriate balance for each site. The ideal balance for most sites will not be found in the stone tablets of Mars or the sensual abandon of Venus. Rather, it will come from each project’s intended audience. Your visitors’ needs set the parameters; your taste, inspiration, and expertise do the rest.</p>
                <p>That tension between structure and style, function and aesthetics, is key to understanding web design and web technology. Users have needs; technology sets limitations. The conflict will resurface throughout this book and your career—and it is only the beginning. Web design is different in fascinating ways. Following are a few key points of difference.</p>
                <h3>Where’s the Map?</h3>
                <p>Books, magazines, <abbr title="Compact Discs">CDs</abbr>, and videocassettes do not need to explain themselves. Most of us read from left to right and top to bottom; we turn the page. We insert the disc or tape and press Play. Websites are not so self-explanatory. Consequently, web designers spend a great deal of effort creating contextual and navigational cues to guide readers, viewers, and "users" through the site.</p>
                <p>Visitors take their cues from non-web experiences. From a lifetime of newspaper reading, they know that headlines carry more weight than sub-heads and body copy. They intuitively grasp that right-pointing arrows mean "more" or "continue." (This intuitive grasp is, of course, the result of previously absorbed social conventions. Red, green, and yellow buttons suggest traffic lights to an American web user; they may mean something different or nothing at all in Papua, New Guinea.) Web users also take their cues from other sites they’ve seen. Soon after figuring out how the modem works, users learn that underlined text is almost always a link, and they know that when the cursor changes shape they are hovering over an "active" link or image.</p>
                <h3>Mars and Venus</h3>
                <p>Adept web designers take care to follow some familiar contextual conventions while breaking or reinventing others. On one site you might use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to turn off link underlining; on another, you preserve link underlining because the site is intended for neophyte users who need to be led by the hand. One site requires idiot-proof icons with text labels; another cries out for subtle, dynamic navigational menus. Usability People lecture sternly about the "sins" of web design, but designers don’t sin—they make decisions. A good web designer may break as many rules as she follows. Visitors determine whether the site succeeds as a piece of communication or is merely a failed, cryptic experiment. This book explores issues of navigation and interface in <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">Chapter 3</a>, "Where Am I? Navigation & Interface." You’ll be exploring them for the rest of your career.</p>
                <p>That we devote an entire chapter to navigation and interface should be indication enough that graphic design alone does not equal web design—a point we’ll restate several times in case some of you haven’t had your coffee yet. Choosing and setting type, crafting pretty buttons, and developing a grid are all well and good but not good enough. Above all, web designers are the architects of user experience.</p>
                <p>You might feel that your training and experience have not prepared you to build such architecture, but you’ll soon see that it’s the web equivalent of what a designer always does: guide viewers toward an understanding.</p>
                <h2>Web Physics: Action and Interaction</h2>
                <p>Design for the Web is different. It’s different because web pages don’t just sit there; they do things. More importantly, they allow visitors to do things. Magazine pages may be beautiful (or not) but the reader’s interactivity consists of reading the page (or not), dog-earing it (or not), and rereading it (or not). At most, the reader might cut it out and mail it to a friend. Strictly speaking, none of this can truly be called interactivity. Beautiful magazine layouts do not change in response to the viewer’s actions. Newspaper ads do not sprout additional body copy if the reader shows genuine interest. The Web invites depth of exploration in ways traditional media cannot. For a designer, the creative possibilities are tantalizing and practically limitless.</p>
                <p>On the Web, linear motion gives way to user emotion. Site visitors link randomly as they choose. Set up as many careful hierarchies and navigational cues as you want; visitors will still do what they like on most sites. Not only may visitors move up, down, and sideways, they also can bookmark any page they fancy; download it to their hard drives; save the images from it; and even study the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup with which it was produced.</p>
                <p>Readers can order books on the Web by typing in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> form fields supported by scripts written in Perl, Java, or other programming languages (<a href="//www.amazon.com" title="Check out amazon.com.">www.amazon.com</a>). They can post their opinions to message boards (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182340/http://www.metafilter.com" title="Check out what metafilter.com looked like back in 2001.">www.metafilter.com</a>). If the designer has given them the option, they may change the background colors to suit their mood (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182203/http://www.camworld.com" title="Check out what camworld.com looked like back in 2001.">www.camworld.com</a>). On fancy Dynamic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (<abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr>) sites, they can drag images from place to place (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010430073327/http://www.dhtmlguis.com/game" title="Check out what dhtmlguis.com/game/ looked like back in 2001.">www.dhtmlguis.com/game/</a>). On fancier ones, they can do much more (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020337/http://assembler.org" title="Check out what assembler.org looked like back in 2001.">www.assembler.org</a>). On a corporate intranet site, employees may spend hours updating a group calendar or adding phone numbers to a contact database. (Anything to avoid working.)</p>

As of this writing, the site was optimized for Netscape and Microsoft’s 4.0 browsers, which rely on proprietary coding techniques. Thus the site’s marvels would be invisible to users of recent browsers that avoid proprietary, old-school <abbr title="Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language">DHTML</abbr>. By the time you buy this book, the site should function well in standards-compliant browsers such as Netscape 6 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020337/http://assembler.org" title="Check out what assembler.org looked like back in 2001.">www.assembler.org</a>).</p>

                        <p>Commercial interactivity: Barnes & Noble, a functional and attractive shopping site. Successful e-commerce sites work in as many browsers as possible and add value to the commercial transaction by providing content and artificially intelligent "shopping tips." Though Barnes & Noble has a real-world heritage, <a href="//Amazon.com" title="Check out Amazon.com.">Amazon.com</a> dominates the online market because Amazon came first. When web brands are effective, users can be incredibly loyal (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182349/http://www.bn.com" title="Check out what bn.com looked like back in 2001.">www.bn.com</a>).</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">There is obvious commercial value to commercial interactivity; novelty or "proof of concept" value to dynamic artwork and games; branding value to interactive multimedia (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20110101011726/http://www.barneys.com" title="Check out what barneys.com looked like back in 2011.">www.barneys.com</a>); and hidden value to still other types of interactivity. (Changing the background color may seem trivial to you or me, but it could be vitally important for a color-blind web user.) Overall, interactivity is a defining characteristic of the Web and thus of web design. Lesbian poetry and physics papers did not drive the rapid expansion of the medium. Commerce did that, and commerce depends on interactivity: the visitor clicks, the sale is made.</p>
                <p>No offense to the lesbian poetry sites. In fact, no offense to the hundreds of thousands of noncommercial sites that bring richness, depth, and meaning to the Web. Without these noncommercial sites, the medium would be nothing more than a dialup variation on the infomercial. But without all the commercial sites, the Web’s infrastructure, services, and rate of adoption might never have grown so quickly.</p>
                <p>At least, that’s what the marketers tell us. Consider this another Mars/Venus variation for your pleasure. The Internet grew in popularity for at least two years before any commercial sites were allowed on the Net, much less the Web. And many defining characteristics of the modern Web ($20 unlimited access dialups, 56K modems, free browsers) were established by 1995-96, a time when most web users were also web designers, and the word "commerce" did not begin with the letter "e." Still, the Web has expanded like nobody’s business since business came online. And if you ask most normal humans who’ve gone online in the past few years why they bought a computer and signed up for an Internet account, "shopping" seems to top the list.</p>
                <h3>Different Purposes, Different Methodologies</h3>
                <p>It is still possible for a lone web designer or small team to create personal, artistic, and corporate sites using an image editor, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, style sheets, and JavaScript. But the "lone rider" approach is increasingly rare in the corporate web development space. Today, teams of specialists with odd-sounding job titles develop most sites collaboratively. (See <a href="5.html" title="Check out chapter 5.">Chapter 5</a>, "The Obligatory Glossary" and <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, "Riding the Project Life Cycle," for the funky titles and the typical web project life cycle.) It is not your job to program a shopping cart or develop a database. It is your job to understand where your work fits into the bigger picture.</p>
                <p>As a professional web designer, you will work closely with programmers to implement the appropriate interactivity in every site. You also might be called upon to execute rudimentary interactivity yourself—for instance, writing JavaScript to swap images on navigational menus.</p>
                <h2>Web Agnosticism</h2>
                <p>Design for the Web is also different because the Web is not a fixed medium. It has no size, no inks, no paper stock. Even your typographic choices may end up as mere suggestions. That’s because the Web is <em>platform-agnostic</em> and <em>device-independent</em>. Good web design adapts to different browsers, monitors, and computing systems. What’s sauce for the goose may not be sauce for the gander. More literally, what’s Geneva for the Mac may be Arial for Windows; what’s <abbr title="Visual Basic">VB</abbr>Script for Windows may be error messages for Mac and Linux users. (So don’t use <abbr title="Visual Basic">VB</abbr>Script to build websites.)</p>
                <p>Looking at poorly implemented sites, you could come away with the impression that the Web is a Windows application or even an extension of the Windows desktop. And there are certainly marketers who’d like you to believe that. But it just ain’t so.</p>
                <p>Berners-Lee and Caillou invented the Web on a NeXT computer. The first browser ever released was for UNIX, the second for Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. Berners-Lee envisioned the Web as a completely portable medium—one that could be accessed not only by every computer operating system (including dumb terminals), but also by all kinds of devices from hand-held Personal Digital Assistants (<abbr title="Personal Digital Assistants">PDAs</abbr>) to telephones and other common appliances. Slowly and sometimes painfully, everything Berners-Lee envisioned in 1990 has been coming true.</p>
                <p>To help the Web evolve in an orderly fashion, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium, or <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101042035/http://www.w3.org" title="Check out what w3.org looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org</a>). It’s a place where university professors join engineers from companies such as Sun, Microsoft, <abbr title="America Online">America Online</abbr>/Netscape, IBM, Compaq, and Apple to hammer out common technological standards, such as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>...and more recently, Extensible Markup Language (<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>) and the Document Object Model (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>). For a complete listing of <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> member organizations, see the following web page: <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101041725/http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List" title="Check out what www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List</a>.</p>
                <p>Don’t worry about what the acronyms stand for at the moment. Just dig the concept: If everyone supports the same standards (or "Recommendations," in <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> parlance), then designers and programmers will have the tools they need to deliver a dynamic and attractive Web that works for any human being, on any platform or device. Sweet, smart, simple.</p>
                <p>Sadly, due to competitive pressures, the desire to innovate, and sheer cussedness, the companies that make web browsers have not always done a superb job of implementing commonly shared standards. In fact, until quite recently, you could argue that their support for these standards was sometimes downright shoddy. You might even be forgiven for suspecting that browser makers deliberately avoided fully implementing any standard for fear that supporting common standards would hurt business.</p>
                <p>In the beginning of this chapter, we mentioned that the Web was spawned as a beautiful medium for the delivery of physics papers. And that to deliver commercially viable sites—sites with some semblance of visual appeal—web designers felt they had no choice but to "hack" <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, forcing the deliberately primitive markup language to serve their aesthetic needs. Netscape (now <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr>) joined web designers in extending <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> beyond its creators’ intentions.</p>
                <p>Initially, the Web was a one-horse town. If you wanted to design a commercial site, you wrote nonstandard <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> that was "optimized" for Netscape’s browser. Once Microsoft’s browser entered the picture, all hell broke loose, as two powerful software companies began deforming <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in mutually exclusive ways.</p>
                <p>Browser development was originally viewed as just another genre of software development. Adobe Illustrator competes with Macromedia Freehand by offering features Freehand lacks. Freehand does the same to Illustrator. God Bless America.</p>
                <p>Similarly, Netscape competed with Microsoft (and vice versa) by offering functionality not supported by the competitor’s product. Each company hoped these unique features would seduce web developers into creating sites optimized for its browser alone.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the market split in two. Though a tiny percentage of web users sported alternative browsers including Lynx, Mosaic, Opera, and Amaya, basically 50% of the market was using Netscape’s browser; the other 50% was using Microsoft’s. To create "technologically advanced" sites for their clients without alienating half the potential visitors, designers and developers felt obliged to create Netscape-specific and Microsoft-specific versions of their sites. Clients then paid more than they should have to support the development of these incompatible site versions. Thanks in part to protests from groups such as The Web Standards Project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050037/http://webstandards.org" title="Check out what webstandards.org looked like back in 2001.">www.webstandards.org</a>) and mainly to the hard work of browser company engineers, support for common standards is constantly improving—though not without occasional backsliding.</p>
                <p>Complicating the issue, many of today’s web standards were yesterday’s proprietary innovations: things that worked only in one browser or another. You can’t blame Wendy’s for not offering McDonald’s secret sauce, and you can’t fault browser companies for failing to implement technology invented by their competitors.</p>
                <p>When Netscape unveiled <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMES></code> (the ability to place one web page inside another), the technology was widely adopted by designers and developers. Refer back to Figure 2.3, <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102020337/http://assembler.org" title="Check out what Assembler.org looked like back in 2001.">Assembler.org</a>, for an example of the way frames work. The bottom frame contains a menu; the top frame contains the content. Clicking the menu changes the content by loading a new content frame. Both frames are controlled by yet a third document, called the <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMESET></code>, which links to the frames, establishes their size and positioning relative to one another, and determines such niceties as whether or not the user can resize a given frame.</p>
                <p>Eventually Netscape brought its invention to the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. Much later, it ended up as part of a temporary standard: the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4 Transitional Recommendation. It took Microsoft a while to support frames, because Microsoft’s browser developers had to reverse-engineer Netscape’s invention to figure out how it worked. Ironically enough, Microsoft’s 4.0 browser eventually supported frames better than Netscape’s.</p>
                <p>In 1995, Netscape came up with a programming language initially called LiveScript and eventually renamed JavaScript. Besides being easy to learn (at least, as far as programming languages go), JavaScript made web pages far more dynamic. And it did this without straining the computers used to serve web pages (<em>servers</em>), because the technology worked in the user’s browser instead of having to be processed by the server itself—the way Perl scripts and other traditional programming languages had been. With less strain on the server, more web pages could be served faster. Thus, JavaScript was bandwidth-friendly.</p>
                <p>JavaScript eventually became a standard, but not before putting Microsoft at a competitive disadvantage for several years. The latest, "standard" version of JavaScript is referred to as <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, which sounds like the noise our Uncle Carl used to make in the morning. Don’t worry—’most everybody still calls it JavaScript, which isn’t exactly Yeatsian poetry either, come to think of it. (<abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script is so named because the European Computer Manufacturers Association [<abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>] supervised the standardization process.) While Netscape and Microsoft invented competitive new technologies, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> worked to develop recommendations that looked beyond the "Browser Wars." At times, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> seemed to be out of touch with what was actually taking place in the market. Back then, the browser companies seemed to be ignoring the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. (The irony is that both <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr>/Netscape and Microsoft participate in the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> and play a vital role in developing the web standards they have sometimes gone on to ignore.) Today it appears that the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is ahead of what browser companies can realistically deliver in the next year or two. Indeed, even hardened web designers with years of experience can feel their innards turn to jelly when reading about upcoming standards proposed by the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. (<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> Namespaces, anybody?)</p>
                <p>The important thing is that there is now a road map for browser companies, developers, and designers. If you took your talent to the Web in the 1990s, you had no way of knowing what new technologies might come down the pike, what new skills you would have to learn, and how quickly what you learned (and designed) would become obsolete. Today we know which standards have been fully or partially implemented in browsers and which ones we can expect to work with in the next year or two. As opposed to the past when Netscape could surprise us by inventing JavaScript and frames or Microsoft could spring <abbr title="Visual Basic">VB</abbr>Script and ActiveX on us and expect us to quickly learn and use those technologies, today we know what to anticipate and what to learn to prepare for the future.</p>
                <h2>Open Standards—They're Not Just for Geeks Anymore</h2>
                <p>We’ll bore you with the details in Part III of this book. For now, it is enough that you understand three fundamentals of web agnosticism.</p>
                <h3>Point #1: The Web Is Platform-Agnostic</h3>
                <p>The Web owes no special fealty to any particular operating system. It is designed to work in Windows, Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, Linux, UNIX, Be<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, Free<abbr title="Berkeley Software Distribution">BSD</abbr>, <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>2, <abbr title="Disk Operating System">DOS</abbr>, and any other platform that comes along. This presents web designers with special challenges in terms of gamma, screen resolution, color palettes, and typography—all of which we’ll explore a bit later in this chapter. This is one heck of a chapter—we hope you realize that. If you get tired and want to take breaks, we’ll understand.</p>
                <p>At first blush, the programmers on your team would seem to have a tougher job than you do. How on earth are they supposed to accommodate all those different operating systems? The answer is, they don’t have to. Browser companies are stuck with the tough job of supporting all those platforms (or a limited subset thereof). Web standards do the rest. JavaScript is JavaScript whether it’s running in Linux or Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. Style sheets are style sheets whether they’re running on Windows 2000 or Be<abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. The more web standards the browsers support and the more completely they support those standards, the fewer migraines programmers (and web users) will have to endure.</p>
                <p>You, on the other hand, will continually test your designs for cross-platform feasibility. You will have to cope with the fact that your favorite Mac system font is not available on the <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> (or vice versa). That those tawny <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> colors look pale as Christina Ricci on the Mac. That the large, bold sans serif headline that looks so dapper on systems with scalable type and built-in anti-aliasing (such as Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> and Windows 98) may look hillbilly-homely on platforms lacking those niceties (such as Linux).</p>
                <p>What You See Is What You Get (<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) programs, such as Macromedia Dreamweaver and Adobe GoLive, attempt to give designers the sensation of retaining complete visual control over web layouts. It is an illusion. A vast majority of professional web designers still hand-code their pages. At the very least, they hand-tweak Dreamweaver- or GoLive-generated code to accommodate the reality of browser and platform differences.</p>
                <p>Browser and platform differences mean that the precise control you’ve come to expect from publishing programs such as Quark XPress and Adobe InDesign simply does not exist on the Web. You can bemoan this fact or learn to create beautiful work that exploits the medium’s changeable nature and facilitates the needs of millions—perhaps even entertaining them in the process. Not such a bad trade-off, when you come right down to it.</p>
                <h3>Point #2: The Web Is Device-Independent</h3>
                <p>Your work not only has to remain usable on a terrifying variety of computer desktops, it also may be accessed via Palm Pilots, web phones, and other instruments of Satan. A year ago it appeared that web designers and programmers would have to continually learn new and incompatible markup languages to accommodate this plethora of web-enabled devices. Instead, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is guiding us toward using Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (<abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>) and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to get the job done. (Don’t panic! <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> is, more or less, simply a newer and cleaner version of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.)</p>
                <p>From <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20100101193152/http://www.w3.org/Mobile/Activity" title="Check out what w3.org/Mobile/Activity looked like back in 2010.">www.w3.org/Mobile/Activity</a>:</p>
                <q>"Mobile devices are unlikely to be able to use exactly the same markup as a normal page for a <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>. Instead they will use a subset of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags. The expectation is that different devices will make use of different modules of <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>; similarly they will support different modules of style sheets. For example, one mobile device might use the basic <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> text module and the style sheet voice module. Another device with a large screen might also allow the <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> tables module."</q>
                <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> website is visually lackluster, unmanageably immense, and written in language only a Stanford professor could love. Nevertheless, the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> is frequently the voice of sanity in the chaos and frenzy of an ever-changing, commerce-driven Web. Learn to overlook the site’s lack of visual panache, and the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> will be your best friend as the Web and your career move forward. Which brings us to Point #3.</p>
                <h3>Point #3: The Web Is Held Together by Standards</h3>
                <p>To design websites, you will have to learn technologies such as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, which really isn’t that hard. As you grow more adept, you will become aware of wonderful features offered in only one browser or another. We advise you to avoid these nonstandard technologies and stick, as much as possible, to what is supported in all browsers.</p>
                <p>You might find yourself working for companies or clients who demand special features that only work in one browser. Just say no. On an intranet site (see <a href="5.html" title="Check out chapter 5.">Chapter 5</a>), it might be feasible to design a site that only works in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5, Netscape 4, or what have you, because those who commission the site control the browsers used to access it. But we’ve heard of plenty of companies that decided to go public with part of their intranet site—only to discover that its nonstandard features locked out millions of web users. We also know an agency that designed an intranet site to take advantage of Netscape 4’s proprietary <abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr> Layers technology. When Netscape abandoned this technology in favor of web standards, the company’s <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> department was unable to upgrade its users to the latest version of Netscape’s browser, which would have made the site nonfunctional. Who took the blame for this fiasco: the client who had insisted on using proprietary, non-standard technology or the web agency that had argued against it? If you’ve had any real experience as a designer, you’ll understand that the question is rhetorical.</p>
                <p>You can often get away with taking the moral high ground simply by explaining to your clients that delivering what they request will cost them 25% or more of their potential audience. The disabled are almost always among the first to be locked out of a site that relies on proprietary technology. Excluding millions of people from a public site is not exactly a brilliant business decision, and ethically speaking, it stinks. Excluding the disabled is also illegal in many instances, at least in the United States. Court cases have been fought over it, and the client usually loses. The Australian Olympics website was one legal casualty; the cost to the site’s owners would have wiped out poverty in three small South American nations. If legal and ethical arguments don’t work with your clients, show them the money.</p>
                <p>Technologies such as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> are the building blocks of web design. In theory, all browsers fully support these standards, delivering on the promise of browser and platform-agnosticism and offering us a Web where we can "write once, publish everywhere." Theory and reality often diverge. In fact, the divergence between them is more or less the story of the Web. The good news is that built-in browser incompatibilities are gradually going the way of the Dodo bird as more standards-compliant browsers become available.</p>
                <h2>The 18-Month Pregnancy</h2>
                <p>In early 2000, Microsoft released <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 Macintosh edition, a browser that delivers top-notch support for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript, three immensely important web standards. Soon afterward, Opera Software released its 4.0 browser, whose principal purpose is to deliver superior support for web standards. And a month before Christmas 2000, Netscape delivered Navigator 6, the most standards-compliant browser yet.</p>
                <p>To read the preceding three sentences not only induces coma, it also suggests that designers are now free to use nothing but <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards in the sites they and their colleagues create.</p>
                <p>Alas, this is not the case. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 for Windows currently offers excellent but incomplete support for standards. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>4, currently the most-used browser on the Web, has good but still less complete support for standards, and Netscape 4, still used by millions, offers even less. Sure, users can upgrade, and eventually they will—but at their own pace.</p>
                <p>We call this upgrade period the <em>18-month pregnancy</em>, based on the time it usually takes before web users feel compelled to switch to an updated browser. Web designers and enthusiasts download new browsers immediately—not so your Uncle Nigel. While you beta-test next year’s browser, your client sticks with <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr> 3. Clients and other normal human beings tend to use the browser that came preinstalled on their computers. They upgrade when they buy a new <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>. Computer manufacturers tend to install 3.0 browsers (considered stable) when 4.0 models are newly available; they offer 4.0 browsers when 5.0 models first come out; and so on. <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> departments are equally conservative, tending to view new browsers the way cats regard changes to their litter. Those who use the Web primarily to shop, send email, or view pornography may not be aware for months that a new browser is available, and when they do find out they often don’t care.</p>
                <p>The browser upgrade path is slow, thus the transition to a Web built purely with standards could take 18 months or longer. Some say we will not see a fully standards-compliant Web before 2003. For the near future, you will likely find it necessary to employ nonstandard <em>workarounds</em> to address specific deficiencies in these older browsers. We’ll explain these workarounds in the relevant chapters on <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Five years ago, the entire Web was a hack, held together with carpet tacks and lasagna. We are better off now than we were then. And soon the nightmare of browser incompatibilities will be a story we tell to bore our grandchildren.</p>
                <h2>Chocolately Web Goodness</h2>
                <p>Having accepted that the Web varies from user to user and browser to browser, and that this will be true even when common standards enjoy universal support, let’s move on to consider the medium’s many unique strengths. If you already consider the Web the greatest thing since gender differentiation, feel free to skip ahead.</p>
                <h3>’Tis a Gift to Be Simple</h3>
                <p>Developing effective web architecture takes great skill. Setting type, designing images and elements, and laying out pages requires consistent vision and intelligence. Programming sites that will serve sophisticated and novice users alike is an art of the highest caliber. But anyone can make a website. A child of six can learn <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and begin self-publishing in a matter of days. No other medium is as easy to learn and produce.</p>
                <p>Millions of personal sites prove this point. Many are of interest mainly to their creator’s immediate family and friends—and that’s okay. But a surprising number offer valuable content and/or sophisticated design. You can view the vast outpouring of personal pages as proof that <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is easy to learn. You also might see in it the unshakable human urge to reach out and connect with others. You can even view it as an extended experiment in democracy.</p>
                <h3>Democracy, What a Concept</h3>
                <p>Every medium in human history has presented a barrier to access. Writers have had to convince publishers that their books were worth distributing (or else build their own printing press, like poet William Blake). Screenwriters must convince studios to invest millions in their visions (and the writer is usually barred from the set once the script has been sold). Movie directors must argue with producers and bankers. Painters need galleries; musicians need concert halls and record deals.</p>
                <p>But the Web presents few such barriers. Buy a computer and a modem, find a hosting provider, learn <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and some UNIX filing conventions, and voila—you are a worldwide publisher! If you can’t afford a computer and modem, most public libraries, universities, and schools offer free Internet access. If hosting fees are beyond your means, companies such as Geocities (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20000610042343/http://geocities.yahoo.com/home/+" title="Check out what geocities.com looked like back in 2000.">www.geocities.com</a>) provide free hosting in exchange for the privilege of running ad banners on your site. The Web places the virtual means of production in the hands of virtually every worker. What would Karl Marx think?</p>

                <p class="clearfix">Speaking of low access barriers, remember the days when you had to expensively laminate print proofs of your best work, slip them into a costly portfolio, and toss them out every six months as your new work made the old stuff obsolete? Well, forget all that. With a free or inexpensive Internet account, you can mount a web portfolio that’s viewable anywhere in the world. Nothing to replace; nothing to bang into the knees of a Neanderthal seated across from you on the subway; nothing for your boss to see you lugging around when you look for a new job on your lunch hour.</p>
                <h2>Instant Karma</h2>
                <p>If the invention of the printing press brought humanity out of the Dark Ages, the building of the Internet and the growth of the Web have ushered in a new information age. It’s an era where every voice can be heard and where truth can win out over lies—even when the liars have million dollar budgets. Say Detroit spews out a bad car (it happens) and decides to dump millions on advertising in the hope of selling it anyway. Message boards on the Web will quickly spread the word that the lemon gets five miles per gallon and spends more time in the shop than on the road. Angry owners may even start a protest site, garnering coverage in the traditional news media. The Web has changed the rules of the market. (See <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010330190743/http://www.cluetrain.org" title="Check out what cluetrain.org looked like back in 2001.">www.cluetrain.org</a> for more on this.)</p>
                <p>It also has changed publishing. Some of the Web’s best-loved authors have never written a traditional book. Others have gotten traditional book deals based on the popularity of their online publications.</p>
                <p>The Web has launched careers, <abbr title="Compact Discs">CDs</abbr>, and movies and brought together the globally scattered members of countless unnamed tribes. You might be the only Sufi in Piggott, Arkansas, but you can find thousands of fellow believers online. If the other kids attending Fredericksburg High don’t share your passion for the music of Bernard Herrmann, you’ll find folks more in tune with your interests online.</p>
                <p>Social commentators sometimes worry that the Web is making us more isolated. In the picture these pundits paint, tortured introverts peck out desperate messages in dark, lonely chat rooms. We take a different view. In ordinary life, extraordinary people often feel terribly isolated because no one around them can understand them other than superficially. The Net and the Web offer real hope and true companionship for those willing to express themselves and seek out like-minded souls. This, we think, is a good thing.</p>
                <h2>The Whole World in Your Hands</h2>
                <p>They don’t call it the <em>World Wide Web</em> for nothing. As individuals, we can not only email pen pals in Istanbul and Amsterdam, we can find out what people in those countries think by reading their personal sites or talking with them in online communities.</p>
                <p>People living in nondemocratic nations can publish their protests anonymously without fear of government retaliation. In lands where all views are tolerated, everyone from amateur gemologists to alien conspiracy freaks can broadcast their theories to a global audience.</p>
                <p>Free online services, such as Alta Vista’s Babelfish (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20030830015858/http://babelfish.altavista.com/TRANSLATE.DYN" title="Check out what babelfish.altavista.com looked like back in 2003.">babelfish.altavista.com</a>) translate text on the Web into a variety of languages. These translations may be awkward and even hilarious—after all, translation is an art best practiced by human beings. But the gist of the text survives the translation. If you publish the story of your child’s first steps on your personal site, your tale may be accessible to families in Indonesia and Zimbabwe.</p>
                <p>The Web not only reaches the world, it changes it. As a web designer, you will be an agent of change, which is a lot easier and much less dangerous than becoming an agent of the <abbr title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</abbr>. You’ll also sleep better, and you won’t have to wear a tie.</p>
                <h2>Just Do It: The Web as Human Activity</h2>
                <p>Unlike any other mass medium, the Web encourages human activity instead of passive consumption. This can have a transformative effect, as consumers become active participants, reinvent themselves as content producers, and launch political parties or small businesses without begging for third-party capital. Armed with nothing more than the Web, individuals or small groups can affect the way the world does business, call global attention to a regional injustice, or bring hope to a cancer patient (<a href="" title="Unfortunately this link is dead. :-(">http://vanderwoning.com/living/blog.html</a>).</p>
                <p>Visit a web community, and you’ll see people who used to channel-surf devoting their leisure hours to arguments, flirtations, and other classic forms of human interactivity. These communities can spill over from the virtual realm to the real world. The members of Redcricket, for example, visit each other’s cities (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012111559/http://www.redcricket.com/start.shtml" title="Check out what redcricket.com looked like back in 2000.">www.redcricket.com</a>). The readers and writers of Fray (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102031506/http://www.fray.org" title="Check out what fray.org looked like back in 2001.">www.fray.org</a>) hold live personal storytelling events each year. The members of Dreamless (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191036/http://www.dreamless.org" title="Check out what dreamless.org looked like back in 2001.">www.dreamless.org</a>) participate in collaborative design projects (<a href="//www.kubrick.org" title="Check out kubrick.org.">www.kubrick.org</a>) and hold noncommercial "underground" design festivals in cities such as London and New York.</p>
                <h2>The Viewer Rules</h2>
                <p>On the Web, the viewer is in control. She can alter the size of your typography. She can turn off images. She can turn off JavaScript. She can force all pages to display her choice of fonts and background colors. In advanced browsers such as Netscape 6 and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac, she can even use her own style sheet to disable or interact with the one you’ve designed. For designers, this can be either a nightmare or a new way of thinking about design. The open-minded may wish to read "A Dao of Web Design" for a positive approach to this aspect of the medium (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010417000022/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/dao" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/dao/ looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com/stories/dao/</a>).</p>
                <p>Designers can thwart the user’s power if they insist—with mixed results. For instance, to force the viewer to see what you want her to see, you can deliver body text in an image instead of typing it in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. This is a classic mistake of the novice web designer. Why is it so wrong? Let us count the ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>If the viewer has turned off images in her browser, she cannot read what you (or your client) have to say.</span></li>
                    <li><span>She cannot copy and paste your text into an email message she’s sending to her family.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Search engines will not see the text because it is embedded in a graphic image, and as a result, fewer people will discover your page.</span></li>
                    <li><span>A near-sighted visitor might find it difficult or impossible to read your 9<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. Futura "graphic text."</span></li>
                    <li><span>As if those are not reasons enough to stick with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text, consider the fact that each image must be downloaded, translated, and displayed by the browser—a process that can take more time than the reader is willing to devote to your site.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Lest you run scared, bear in mind that most web users rarely, if ever, change their browsers’ defaults. By default, images are turned on, JavaScript is turned on, and style sheets are turned on, which means that your typographic choices and other design decisions come through intact (albeit filtered by the visitor’s browser and platform). Nevertheless, educated users do have the power to filter your work through their preferences, so it is important to think of web design as a partnership with the people who read and view your sites and to accept the fact that your layouts might be transformed by visitors with special needs or quirky preferences.</p>

                <h2 class="clearfix">Multimedia: All Talking! All Dancing!</h2>
                <p>The Web not only presents text and images, it also can present music, movies, and unique forms of interactive animation such as interactive vector animations created in Macromedia Flash (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010207033801/http://macromedia.com/software/flash" title="Check out what flash.com looked like back in 2001.">www.flash.com</a>) and videos delivered in the QuickTime, Real, or Windows Media Player formats. Design benefits include the power to absolutely mesmerize viewers. Design challenges include creating the work itself; optimizing the work so that it streams quickly to the viewer’s browser instead of taking half an hour to download; and developing alternative content for those who cannot view the multimedia file. Additional challenges include avoiding cliches and knowing when multimedia is inappropriate.</p>
                <p>On the Web, multimedia is most often delivered through free players (such as RealPlayer) and free browser "plug-ins." These are much like the third-party plug-ins that add new capabilities to programs such as Adobe Photoshop, except that they’re free. Browser plug-ins are downloadable mini-applications that handle specific types of multimedia (<abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr>) content. For instance, the QuickTime plug-in (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101041748/http://www.apple.com/quicktime" title="Check out what apple.com/QuickTime/ looked like back in 2001.">www.apple.com/QuickTime/</a>) allows Mac and Windows users to view digitized videos. It also plays <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> audio files, Windows <abbr title="Waveform Audio File Format">WAV</abbr> audio files, Windows <abbr title="Audio Video Interleave">AVI</abbr> movies, <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> images, <abbr title="Bitmap">BMP</abbr> images, and other common media formats.</p>
                <p>When the visitor encounters a web page with an embedded QuickTime movie (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010410203503/http://www.apple.com/trailers" title="Check out what apple.com/trailers/ looked like back in 2001.">www.apple.com/trailers/</a>), she can watch the movie with a click of the mouse. If she hasn’t installed the plug-in yet, she can download it and then watch the movie. The QuickTime plug-in comes standard in both Netscape and Explorer’s browsers, so the issue is moot for most web users, who usually use one or both of these browsers. Flash and RealPlayer also come standard with Netscape’s browsers.</p>
                <h3>The Server Knows</h3>
                <p>The quality of the movie may vary depending on the visitor’s access speed. With QuickTime 4 and higher, for instance, the faster the connection, the larger the movie and the higher its quality. This is accomplished through an ingenious scheme whereby QuickTime content is exported (saved) at a variety of quality levels and stored as a series of related files on the web server. When the visitor’s browser requests the file, the server checks to determine the visitor’s connection speed and responds with the appropriately optimized file.</p>
                <p>How does the server "know" the user’s connection speed? The plug-in "tells" the server. QuickTime includes a control panel, which asks the user to select her connection speed. This information is then conveyed to the plug-in. Ingenious.</p>
                <p>The server actually knows quite a lot about each site visitor’s setup. For instance, it knows what kind of browser is requesting each file on a given web page, which version of that browser (5.0, 5.5, and so on) is being used, and which operating system runs on the visitor’s desktop. The ability to access this information can be quite useful when you’re coping with browser and platform incompatibilities—as we’ll discuss in <a href="11.html" title="Check out chapter 11.">Chapter 11</a>, "The Joy of JavaScript."</p>
                <p>Because the server finds out and records this information every time a web page file is requested, you also can find it out for yourself by checking your site’s referrer logs. What are those? Glad you asked.</p>
                <p><em>Referrer logs</em> are a standard means of letting the site’s builders or owners know how many people are visiting, what browser and platform they’re using, and which third-party sites "referred" these visitors via links. They also track the national origin of each unique visitor, tell you which pages are the most visited, and much more. Referrer logs are cool.</p>
                <p>You won’t find your visitors’ names, addresses, and telephone numbers, of course. That information is private, not because all site owners are decent human beings but because such information is unknowable unless the visitor has voluntarily supplied it.</p>
                <p>On certain news sites (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040057/http://www.nytimes.com" title="Check out what nytimes.com looked like back in 2001.">www.nytimes.com</a>) and some database-driven sites, the visitor must enter this private data before accessing content. The data is then stored on a cookie on the visitor’s hard drive, allowing the user to return to the site without having to undergo the tedious log-in process each time. Advertisers and site owners foam at the mouth over the possibility of procuring information like this. We’ve even had a client ask if there was any way to find out each user’s business phone number "without telling them." (Answer: No, and if there were, we wouldn’t tell <em>you</em>.)</p>
                <p>Web users’ privacy concerns make them unlikely to provide personal data without sufficient motivation. Reading <em>The New York Times</em> free of charge may constitute sufficient motivation. Finding out more about <span class="orange">Widgets.com</span> probably does not.</p>
                <p>Many sites over the years have unwittingly erected barriers by forcing users to enter personal data without first giving a clear picture of what the user would gain by doing so. Many of these were sites flung together like so much moldy cheese by traditional media moguls. When users failed to register, the moguls would claim that "Web content doesn’t work" (if the ill-conceived site was their own) or trumpet the failure far and wide (if the site belonged to a competitor). Some of these sites offered decent content, but few folks were willing to cross the privacy barrier to find out about it.</p>
                <p>Though web users are understandably reluctant to reveal their salaries and sexual preferences merely to view content, the server’s tracking of less sensitive information can still be incredibly useful to the design and development team. For instance, if you discover that a great many visitors are coming from Sweden, you might commission a Swedish translation of the site—thereby enticing still more Swedes to visit. If you learn that 90% of your audience is using a 5.0 browser or better, you can incorporate standards-based dynamic technologies with less fear of alienating your core user base. The combination of server user awareness and sophisticated plug-ins such as QuickTime allows you to craft the optimum experience for each visitor.</p>
                <p>The server can always tell each user’s connection speed, operating system, and browser. This allows sophisticated plug-ins like QuickTime to deliver the optimum experience for each user. As we’ll see later, it also enables us to do clever and useful things with JavaScript.</p>
                <p>Not every player or plug-in format accommodates user connection speed in precisely the same way that QuickTime does. A Flash movie, for instance, does not vary depending on the user’s connection speed; it is always the same Flash movie. Flash, however, was designed specifically to couple rich multimedia experiences with compact file sizes. Why is this important?</p>
                <h2>It's the Bandwidth, Stupid</h2>
                <p>Aside from corporate users and a few lucky folks with Digital Subscriber Line (<abbr title="Digital Subscriber Line">DSL</abbr>) or cable modem access, most people view the Web through dial-up connections, which are not exactly peppy. In every multimedia format, digital compression is used to compensate for the narrowness of the user’s "pipe"—the limitations of her bandwidth. As mentioned earlier, bandwidth represents the rate at which web content may be downloaded to the end-user’s computer. Remember David Siegel’s cry of "Clarity, Brevity, Bandwidth?" Bandwidth is arguably the most important component of this trinity. Web users will spend more time with mediocre sites that load fast than they will waiting for beauty that takes forever to show up on their screens. (Q. What’s the most popular button on the Web? A. The Back button.)</p>
                <p>Dialup modems top out at 56K. That’s 56 kilobits, or 6 kilobytes, per second. (Actually, it’s even less than that: The <abbr title="Federal Communications Commission">FCC</abbr> mandates a top speed of 53K. Read the fine print on your modem.) Due to modem overheads ranging from 1% to 15%, phone line noise, server traffic levels, Internet congestion, and the alignment of the planets, modems rarely if ever actually achieve their top speed. 33.6 modems can do no better than 4.2K per second and frequently do less. 28.8 modems typically deliver 3 to 3.5K per second.</p>
                <p>In ideal conditions, under a blue moon, on the Twelfth of Never, a home user is downloading less than 6K per second. So a 600K movie will take <em>at least</em> 100 seconds to download to the user’s computer. The greater a format’s compression ratio, the fewer kilobytes (or megabytes) your visitors have to download and the sooner they can start enjoying what you have to offer.</p>
                <p>Flash, RealPlayer, QuickTime, and Windows Media Player all stream their content (begin playing the file soon after downloading begins). But even streaming formats are limited by the bandwidth constrictions of the end-user’s modem. Streaming or not, no multimedia format can pour its data faster than the user’s modem can drink it.</p>
                <p>As you might expect, the format that compresses best uses the least band-width and is therefore the most popular. The RealPlayer (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040126/http://www.real.com" title="Check out what real.com looked like back in 2001.">www.real.com</a>) is the "best-selling" free video player on the market because it compresses video and audio down to sizes that work well even over dialup modems (though 56K modems are strongly recommended). QuickTime files tend to be larger than Real files and have higher quality; again, as common sense would lead you to expect, QuickTime is not quite as popular as RealVideo. Windows Media Player is currently the third most popular streaming format. Though it’s native to the Windows Operating System, an oddly named "Windows Media Player for Macintosh" is available also, and seems to work well enough.</p>
                <p>When appropriate, these players and plug-ins enable designers to bring rich multimedia (and in the case of Flash, interactivity) to the Web. And of course, when used unwisely, they make the medium a virtual hell of ugly spinning logos, unwanted soundtracks, and other detritus that adds insult to injury by taking forever to download.</p>
                <h2>Web Pages Have No Secrets</h2>
                <p>Web pages are immodest. You can see what’s under their clothes. You can’t learn the design secrets of a print layout by looking, touching, or clicking; but you can easily do this on the Web.</p>
                <p>To begin with, every browser since Mosaic, released in 1993, has a menu item called View Source. As you’d expect, this allows you to view the source code of any web page. How the heck did the designer pull off that intricate web layout? View the source and find out. How did they make the image change when you dragged your mouse across it? Click View Source and study their JavaScript code. It is, of course, possible to obfuscate JavaScript source code, making it difficult for source snoops to understand what is going on. It’s also possible to write extremely ugly code, but that’s usually not intentional. For an example of the former, use View Source and compare: <a href="" title="Unfortunately this link is dead. :-(">http://dhtml-guis.com/game/poetry.opt.html</a> versus <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20040206134658/http://www.dhtml-guis.com/game/2/poetry.html" title="Check out what dhtml-guis.com/game/poetry.html looked like back in 2004.">http://dhtml-guis.com/game/poetry.html</a>.</p>
                <p>Naturally, you need to know enough about <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or scripting languages to understand the code you’re looking at. Conversely, the more source code you view, the more you’ll learn about the code that makes web pages work. Most web designers learn their trade this way. In fact it’s fair to say that for every <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> book sold, there are a thousand web pages whose source code has been studied for free. Well, perhaps it’s not fair to say, but we’ve gone ahead and said it anyway, and since we get paid by the word, we’re adding yet another irrelevant clause to the mess.</p>
                <p>he ability to view source code is there for a reason: to teach <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and other markup and scripting languages by example. Even sharp operators who know all the angles are constantly learning new tricks and techniques by studying their peers’ sources.</p>
                <p>Make a mental note never to steal someone else’s source code outright. All you want to do is learn from it. This is an ethical and professional issue, not a legal one. Unlike text, artwork, and photography, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup is not protected by copyright, even though some web designers claim otherwise.</p>
                <p>Unscrupulous designers do steal each other’s code, but this is a bad practice. If the moral issues do not concern you, imagine your embarrassment—and possible business difficulties—should your client receive an angry letter from a designer whose code you swiped. It’s not worth the risk.</p>
                <p>In <a href="8.html" title="Check out chapter 8.">Chapter 8</a>, "<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the Building Blocks of Life Itself," we’ll teach you how to View Source in your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor of choice rather than inside the browser. Because many designers won’t bother reading that chapter, we’ll pad it out with poignant childhood reminiscences and jokes involving creamed corn.</p>
                <p>In addition to View Source, Netscape Navigator’s menu bar offers an option to View Document (or Page) Info. Choose it, and the entire page will be deconstructed for you in a new window, image by image. Beside each image’s name you’ll find its complete <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> (its address on the Web), its file size, how many colors it contains, and whether or not it uses transparency. Click the link beside each image, and the image will load in the bottom of the window. By viewing page info, you may discover that a large image is actually composed of smaller pieces stuck together with a borderless <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> table or that what looks like one image is actually two: a transparent foreground <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image file floating atop a separate background image. Or you’ll discover invisible (transparent) images, used to control the spacing of elements on old-fashioned web pages. (Today, designers use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to accomplish the same thing without subverting the structural purpose of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Throw out those old web design books. The tricks they teach are outdated and considered harmful to the future of the Web.)</p>
                <p>Microsoft’s Internet Explorer does not let you view page info the way Netscape’s browser does. But both browsers are free, and as a designer you will be using both anyway. In fact, you’ll regularly be checking your work in at least two generations of Netscape and Microsoft’s browsers and then double-checking it in Web<abbr title="Television">TV</abbr>, Opera, iCab, and Lynx.</p>
                <p>In all likelihood, even when all browsers fully support common standards, you will still have to check your work in multiple browsers to avoid browser bugs—and of course you will have to view your work on multiple platforms. Or at least ask people on web design mailing lists to check it for you.</p>
                <h3>The Web Is for Everyone!</h3>
                <p>The last version of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>—<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4—goes out of its way to make sure that everyone can use the Web, from Palm Pilot owners to the blind and from English speakers to, uh, non-English speakers. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4 contains improved accessibility features that enable web designers to accommodate all potential users, thus better fulfilling the medium’s mandate. Throughout this book we’ll be talking about ways to make your content accessible to everyone.</p>
                <p>Web design is different because websites must be compatible with many browsers, operating systems, and access speeds. The following sections discuss some of the challenges that make all the difference between designing and designing for the medium.</p>
                <h3>It’s Still the Bandwidth, Stupid</h3>
                <p>In the preceding section on multimedia, we defined bandwidth in terms of bits and bytes per second. The key to bandwidth is realizing that there is never enough of it. Design with a few small files, and you remove the bandwidth obstacle for most of your potential audience. Design with large files, and your audience shrinks to a chosen few who enjoy fast access at all times. Design with many large files per page, and your audience shrinks to you and you alone.</p>
                <p>Bandwidth issues are complicated by the amount of traffic clogging the network. A corporate T1 line is very fast—until 500 employees log on over their lunch hour. Then it can be as dreary as the slowest home dialup modem.</p>
                <p>Similarly, 10 early adopters share a super-fast cable modem line. They brag to their friends who quickly subscribe to the service and tell their buddies about it. Soon 1,000 people are connected to the same cable modem line, and it is no longer reliably fast because the available upstream bandwidth has shrunk. The cable modem is still offering the same peppy connectivity, but the bandwidth is now shared across multiple users.</p>
                <p>Likewise, an Internet Service Provider (<abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>) brags in its advertising that it offers multiple, redundant T3 connectivity (very, very fast). The advertising campaign is so successful that a million new users subscribe to the service, and suddenly the bandwidth available to any given subscriber is low. <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>s are like airlines. Airlines overbook flights, causing you to miss connections. <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>s underestimate needed capacity, slowing down connections. Bandwidth never exceeds the speed of the weakest link. Your corporate T1 line does you little good if the site is being served from a home machine connected to the Internet via the owner’s Integrated Digital Services Network (<abbr title="Integrated Digital Services Network">IDSN</abbr>) line. Or the server may be fast and powerful, but if a connecting router goes down in Chicago, bandwidth will slow to a trickle.</p>
                <p>Differences in national phone service contribute to the problem. Sites served from Japan, Australia, and France are almost always slow to reach the <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> no matter how powerful the server and no matter how fast the connection on your end.</p>
                <p>Bandwidth also may be negatively impacted if the server is overloaded due to temporary traffic at one of the sites it serves. In 1999, when Internet Channel (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101071254/http://www.inch.com" title="Check out what inch.com looked like back in 2001.">www.inch.com</a>) in New York City hosted a live webcast by Steve Jobs of Apple Computer, demand for Jobs’s address ran so high that all sites on that server ran slower than normal—even though those other sites were unaffiliated with the Apple broadcast.</p>
                <p>So let us repeat: There is never enough bandwidth. Therefore, the best web design is that which conserves bandwidth.</p>
                <p>Good web designers are constantly performing digital sleight of hand to conserve bandwidth. By contrast, beginning web slingers with a background in design will typically create a comp in Adobe Photoshop, cut it apart in Adobe ImageReady, and use Macromedia Dreamweaver or Adobe GoLive to put it together again as a working web page. The page may look divine, but it’s almost guaranteed to hog bandwidth.</p>
                <p>So how do we conserve bandwidth?</p>
                <h4>Swap text and code for images</h4>
                <p>For one thing, we conserve bandwidth by using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text instead of typographic images wherever we can. As mentioned earlier, images must be downloaded, decoded, and expanded in the browser—and that takes time. Text may be downloaded in a fraction of the time. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is text-based and is thus a bandwidth-friendly technology. ImageReady is a great tool, but don’t expect it to make all your decisions for you. If you use ImageReady or Macromedia Fireworks to generate the pieces of a web page, be prepared to replace some of those pieces with bandwidth-friendly <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
                <h4>Trim those image files</h4>
                <p>We also conserve bandwidth by reducing the file size of our images when exporting them (saving them in web-friendly formats) from Photoshop. All designers know that file sizes diminish as resolution decreases. A 1200<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> (pixels-per-inch) image takes up more megabytes than the same image at 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr>. On the Web, all images are rendered at 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr>, but that is only the beginning. Later in this chapter, we’ll discuss techniques for squeezing high quality out of small image files, and (again) replacing images with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> even when you use a tool like ImageReady to automate part of the process.</p>
                <h4>Do more with less</h4>
                <p>Slicing a large image into a dozen pieces may reduce the bandwidth required by each piece, but there is a trade-off. As the server responds to one image request after another, the cumulative bandwidth used might be higher than needed to serve a smaller number of larger images. Each design requires you to experiment with these trade-offs.</p>
                <h4>Prune redundancy</h4>
                <p>Another technique to conserve bandwidth is to remove redundancy from <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> code. If you’re unfamiliar with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, you can scan <a href="8.html" title="Check out chapter 8.">Chapter 8</a> for a quick overview. But even if you don’t, the following example will probably make sense to you. If not, just nod along and come back later.</p>
                <p>In traditional web design, we use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables to position text and images on the page. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables are just like tables in a spreadsheet, except that the borders are usually turned off (border="0") to hide the underlying technology from viewers. By default, elements in a table cell are left-aligned unless the programmer has specified otherwise by typing something like <code class="nopad">&lt;td align="center"></code> or <code class="nopad">&lt;td align="right"></code>. Therefore, in an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> layout, it is unnecessary to type:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;td align="left"></code></p>
                <p>In our code, when:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;td></code></p>
                <p>Will suffice. Now, <code class="nopad">&lt;align="left"></code> does not eat much bandwidth on its own, but multiplied thousands of times throughout a site, that kind of unnecessary markup adds up to a significant waste of bandwidth per visitor. If the site wastes 10K of bandwidth on each visitor, and one million visitors access the site each week, the waste of bandwidth is multiplied to an astounding 10 gigabytes per week, and visitors may experience a decline in the overall responsiveness of the web server.</p>
                <p>Strange as it seems, we can even conserve bandwidth by minimizing white space in our <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents. Users never see these documents unless they are utilizing View Source, and technically, the amount of white space makes no difference in the rendering of the site. For example, this <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> snippet:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;div align="Center"><br>
                        &lt;form><br>
                        &lt;input type="button" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: geneva, arial, sans-serif; background-color: #ff6600; color: #ffffff;" value="Previous Reports" onClick="window.location=’com0800a.html’;" onMouseOver="window.status=’More of same.’; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=’’;return true;"><br>
                        &lt;/form><br>
                        &lt;/div><br><br>
                        &lt;p><br> 
                        <span class="nbsp">&nbsp;</span>&lt;br><br>
                        &lt;/p>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Is functionally identical to this <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> snippet:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;div align="Center">&lt;form>&lt;input type="button" style="font-size: 12px; font-family: geneva, arial, sans-serif; background-color: #ff6600; color: #ffffff;" value="Previous Reports" onClick="window.location=’com0800a.html’;" onMouseOver="window.status =’More of same.’; return true;" onMouseOut="window.status=’’;return true;">&lt;/form>&lt;/div>&lt;p>&nbsp;&lt;br>&lt;/p></code></p>
                <p>Note that this technique cannot be applied to the entire web page. If you mess with the white space and line breaks in JavaScript, you can generate scripting errors that cause pages to fail. It is only safe to delete the extra white space in the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> portion of each document. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> does not care whether the white space is there or not. But extra white space adds to the character count, which in turn, beefs up the document’s overall weight. An <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document with plenty of white space can weigh in at 11K, while an identical document without white space may be as little as 9K. Certainly, 2K is a negligible amount of bandwidth, but multiplied by a million users a week as per the previous example, it once again becomes significant.</p>
                <p>Before you rush off and start deleting all the white space from your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> files, bear in mind that white space helps the eye make sense of the code. Because a site that never changes is a site that soon loses its traffic, you will frequently find yourself reopening documents you created months before to update the content and design. Just as often, a coworker will have to open and revise a document you created, or you’ll be editing one of theirs. Moreover, web design is becoming more and more collaborative, which means more and more documents change hands throughout the process. For this reason, most web designers leave plenty of white space in their documents—along with a trail of <strong>comments</strong> which help the designer or her successors make sense of the markup.</p>
                <h6>Typical Comments in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>
                        <code>
                        &lt;! -- Begin the menu bar here. --><br>
                        &lt;! -- This script is used to preload images. --&gt;<br> 
                        &lt;! -- Another pathetic hack. -->
                        </code>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>Bandwidth is key but not at the price of sanity. Nevertheless, some web shops routinely save bandwidth by removing the white space from their <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents. To protect themselves from suicidal despair, these shops first save a legible copy of each document and preserve it offline. When a particular <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document needs to be updated, the designer or producer opens the original document, not the one from which white space has been removed.</p>
                <p>Because it can be problematic and because it requires keeping duplicate files, most shops don’t bother with this level of bandwidth conservation.</p>
                <p>Okay, we’re sorry we mentioned the whole thing.</p>
                <h2>Cache as Cache Can</h2>
                <p>One of the best ways to minimize bandwidth is to employ the caching mechanism built into all web browsers. The caching mechanism, which lives on the end-user’s hard drive, is like a warehouse where files that have already been downloaded are stored in case the user needs them again. For instance, if a visitor returns to a previously viewed web page, the images on that page are loaded from her cache instead of having to be downloaded from the Web a second time. Because the files are already sitting on the hard drive, they load almost instantly.</p>
                <p>That’s all well and good for the web user, but how does it apply to the web designer’s job?</p>
                <p>The answer is simple: The more we reuse graphic elements, the less strain we put on our visitors’ bandwidth. If we reuse the same graphic menu bar elements from page to page, these elements only have to be downloaded once. From then on, whenever the visitor hits a new page, the familiar menu bar graphics are reloaded from the cache on her hard drive. By contrast, if we change the design of the menu bar on each page, the visitor must download new graphics with every page, thus slowing the site experience (and adding to the toll on the server).</p>
                <p>Repetitive elements help visitors make sense of the site; ever-changing elements confuse and disorient visitors. (Ever-changing elements don’t help reinforce branding, either.) The need to minimize bandwidth, reinforce branding, and present the user with a comprehensible and intuitive navigational system all point to the same moral here: Keep using the same stuff over and over, relying on the user’s cache to serve as much of the site as possible.</p>

                <h3 class="clearfix">Much Ado About 5k</h3>
                <p>The need to conserve bandwidth is so essential that in 2000, Stewart Butterfield created a "5k Contest" challenging web designers to create some of the smallest sites in the world: complete websites that would weigh in at under 5 kilobytes. (To put this in perspective, 5K equals about seven or eight short paragraphs of plain text.)</p>
                <p>To Butterfield’s astonishment, thousands of web designers responded to the challenge. You can see the results at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050056/http://the5k.org" title="Check out what the5k.org looked like back in 2001.">www.the5k.org</a>. As you marvel at some of these creative solutions, bear in mind that the average web page is 32K (over 6 times as large as the 5k winners). (The average corporate web page is often much larger than that.) The 5k Contest proves that our pages do not have to be nearly so bloated. As a web design professional, you will always be seeking new ways to minimize bandwidth.</p>
                <h2>Screening Room</h2>
                <p>Luxuriating in your monitor’s 21" screen, you design a site that looks sensational. How will it look on a 14" screen? Will it even fit? That is the challenge of screen resolution.</p>
                <p>Screens range from 14" to 21" (and higher), with 15" and 17" currently the most popular. By the time this book is printed, 17" screens will dominate the home market, and ladies named Mistress Beatrice will dominate everywhere else. Laptops will continue to offer 14" and 15" screens along with the coveted 17-incher. Not only do screens vary, resolutions vary. Some folks view the web at 640 x 480; others at 1600 x 1200 (or even higher). This wild fluctuation in monitor size and screen resolution has a critical effect on page layout.</p>
                <p>Are we saying that your site must be able to fit inside a 640 x 480 environment? No, you don’t always have that much space. Consider that browsers do not make full use of the screen. In Windows, room is left at the bottom for the task bar, while the top of the screen is taken up with browser chrome (the buttons and text entry fields that allow users to navigate the Web). In Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, the right-hand side of the screen is reserved for that little trail of icons representing the user’s hard drive, saved files, and other work-related shortcuts, and the top of the screen is again given over to browser chrome.</p>
                <p>Accounting for <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> interface elements and browser chrome, the usable space may be less than 580 x 380. But if you design precisely to fit that small space as if it were a fixed newspaper ad size, your site may look forlorn or even ludicrous on a larger monitor running at 1600 x 1200. What’s a mother to do?</p>
                <h3>Liquid Design</h3>
                <p>The solution is to embrace the fluid nature of the medium and, whenever possible, design in a resolution-independent manner. Glenn Davis, web critic and former Chief Technology Officer of <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182117/http://www.projectcool.com" title="Check out what Projectcool.com looked like back in 2001.">Projectcool.com</a>, uses the phrase <em>Liquid Design</em> to describe an approach to web design in which the content reflows as it is "poured" into any monitor size.</p>
                <p>Narrow your browser window to 640 pixels or thereabouts, and visit <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012080428/http://www.jazzradio.net/indexf.html" title="Check out what jazzradio.net looked like back in 2000.">www.jazzradio.net</a> (see Figure 2.8). Now stretch your window as wide as it will go (Figure 2.9). Notice how the entire layout reflows to fill the screen.

                        <p>…and equally well if the monitor is large. Liquid Design makes users of any size monitor feel equally at home (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012080428/http://www.jazzradio.net/indexf.html" title="Check out what jazzradio.net looked like back in 2000.">www.jazzradio.net</a>).</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">There are limits to how wide a web layout may be stretched before it begins to look ludicrous, but the goal is not to provide hours of "squash and stretch" fun for web users. (They’re not going to perform this exercise anyway.) The goal is to provide a site that seems to naturally fit each visitor’s monitor. This makes the visitor feel right at home, thereby encouraging her to spend more time on the site and drink milk right out of the carton when she thinks you’re not looking.</p>
                <p>By contrast, with a more rigid approach to web layout, your site might appear to be "shoved into the corner" of a user’s large monitor. Or it might be too wide for the user’s small monitor, forcing her to scroll left and right (or more probably, encouraging her to leave and never come back).</p>
                <p>A great majority of websites are designed at 800 x 600 fixed resolution in the belief that most users have screens wide enough to accommodate this width and height. True, "most" users can accommodate it, but why not build something that fits every user like a glove?</p>
                <p>With Liquid Design, you can do just that.</p>
                <p>By contrast, Banana Republic (<a href="//bananarepublic.com" title="Check out bananarepublic.com.">www.bananarepublic.com</a>) (see Figure 2.10) and Three.oh (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010330072421/http://threeoh.com/structure.html" title="Check out what threeoh.com looked like back in 2001.">www.threeoh.com</a>) offer fixed web layouts using absolute heights and widths. Banana Republic’s site does this to fit inside small monitors. It certainly does that, but its attractiveness is marred on large monitors—where most of the screen lies empty and yearning.</p>
                <figure>

                        <p>Fixed web layouts can be attractive, but on larger monitors the design can suffer from that "shoved into the corner" feeling (<a href="//bananarepublic.com" title="Check out bananarepublic.com.">www.bananarepublic.com</a><wbr>). Sites must be designed to work on small monitors but need not be designed to look ludicrous on large ones. Liquid Design can solve this problem.</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">Where <a href="//bananarepublic.com" title="Check out bananarepublic.com.">bananarepublic.com</a> chooses a fixed layout approach to accommodate dinky screens, Three.oh’s large, fixed layout requires the visitor to own a monitor big enough to take in the entire design at a glance. Three.oh is elegantly designed and serves an audience of graphic artists. Thus, the assumption that site visitors possess a large enough monitor to see the whole thing is reasonable enough. But by adhering to a print-like model of site design, using absolute widths and font sizes, Three.oh rules out visitors saddled with small monitors as well as the visually impaired. The site’s designers no doubt feel justified in doing this because nondesigners and visually impaired folks could not possibly be interested in what the site has to offer. Most sites cannot make assumptions like this.</p>
                <p>Liquid Design is accomplished through <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables that are built with percentages (rather than absolute widths), framesets that use percentages (rather than absolute widths), or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Because 4.0 browsers are still in use at the time of this writing and will be for at least the next year, and because <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support is less than perfect in 4.0 browsers, most designers choose tables or framesets to get the job done. We’ve created a simplified <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> example to show how Liquid Design differs from print-like, fixed design. Peek ahead to <a href="8.html" title="Check out chapter 8.">Chapter 8</a> if the markup confuses you.</p>
                <h6>Traditional versus Liquid Design</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>Here is a traditional, print-like approach to web design that uses table cells with absolute widths. All extraneous code has been deleted from this radically simplified example to focus on the points of difference between print-like and Liquid Design.</p>
                    <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;html><br>
                        &lt;table width="600"><br>
                        &lt;tr><br>
                        &lt;td width="400"><br>
                        &lt;p>Content goes here.&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;td width="200"><br>
                        &lt;p>Navigation goes here. This column is half as wide as the content column.&lt;/p><br> 
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;/tr><br>
                        &lt;/table><br>
                        &lt;/html>
                    </code>
                    </p>
                    <p>Next, a similar web page, but this time it’s liquid. Specifying percentages rather than absolute widths enables the page to fit any screen while preserving the relative proportions of the original layout.</p>
                    <p>
                    <code>	
                        &lt;html><br>
                        &lt;table width="100%"><br>
                        &lt;tr><br>
                        &lt;td width="66%"><br>
                        &lt;p>Content goes here.&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;td width="34%">>&lt;p>Navigation goes here. As in the previous example, this column is half as wide as the content column. However, this table will stretch or squash to fit any monitor comfortably.&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;/tr><br>
                        &lt;/table><br>
                        &lt;/html>
                    </code>	
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>The liquid approach handles our horizontal problem, but what about the vertical? Simple: Remember that the first 380 pixels of vertical space is the only area that all your visitors are certain to see without scrolling. Make sure that your navigational menu (if any), logo (if any), headlines (if any), and other important content fits comfortably within that vertical area. Less important information can fall below the fold, and no harm done. Your client’s advertisers will be clamoring for placement at the top of the screen for this very reason. Alas, if they get their wish, those with small monitors will see browser chrome, ad banners, and task bars to the exclusion of almost everything else. No wonder some people hate the Web the first time they see it.</p>
                <h2>Color My Web</h2>
                <p>As with the wide variety in screen resolutions, computers are far from uniform in their ability to display color. Designers work with machines that support millions of colors (24 or 32 bits). But many computer users are limited to thousands of colors (16 bits), and a significant minority is stuck with 256 colors (8 bits) or less.</p>
                <p>Monitors that are limited to 256 colors face an additional problem in that up to 40 of these colors are "used up" in advance by the operating system itself. For instance, Windows reserves 40 Windows system colors for its own display purposes in lower-end color environments. That leaves exactly 216 colors at your disposal.</p>
                <p>In 1994, the makers of Netscape Navigator mathematically subdivided the color spectrum into 216 web-safe colors, which are equidistant from each other along the color wheel. You will hear this mathematical arrangement of web-safe colors variously referred to as the Netscape Color Cube, the web-safe palette, and variations thereof, many of them unprintable in a family publication.</p>
                <p>The Color Cube is the bane of many web designers’ existence, but it need not be. Paper stocks have limitations; so do type families, and so does the Web. This is one of those limitations you can master upon accepting it as part of the discipline the medium imposes.</p>
                <h6>Know the Code</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>Photoshop 5 (and higher) includes a web-safe color palette, and the included VisiBone color palette is even more useful because it arranges the colors in ways with which designers can understand and work. But how can you tell in code alone if your colors are web-safe? Easy. Know the code. In <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, all colors are indicated in three pairs (six digits) of hexadecimal code.</p>
                    <p>This, for instance, is red: <span class="orange">#ff0000</span>.</p>
                    <p>And this is a darker red: <span class="orange">#cc0000</span>.</p>
                    <p>What are these little characters? They are hexadecimal code for the Red, Green, and Blue channels of an <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> monitor. The first two digits indicate the amount of light pouring from the monitor’s Red channel; the second pair tells how much Green appears; and the third tells how much Blue.</p>
                    <p>With <span class="orange">#ff0000</span>, the Red channel is going full blast (<span class="orange">#ff</span> is the highest possible two-digit value in hexadecimal), and the other two channels are "turned off" (<span class="orange">#00</span>). (Most of the time, you will be working with subtler color values.)</p>
                    <p>Web-safe colors are composed only of the following hexadecimal pairs:</p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span class="orange">00</span></td>
                            <td><span class="orange">33</span></td>
                            <td><span class="orange">66</span></td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td><span class="orange">99</span></td>
                            <td><span class="orange">cc</span></td>
                            <td><span class="orange">ff</span></td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>
                    <p>Thus, <span class="orange">#3399ff</span> is a web-safe color, while <span class="orange">#07ba42</span> is not.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Only the 216 web-safe colors (colors that can be described with the hexadecimal pairs indicated in the previous sidebar) are guaranteed to display correctly in both Windows and Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> in the 8-bit environment. Any other color will <em>dither</em> (be broken into dots) on a 256-color monitor and will <em>shift</em> (change to an unintended and subtly mismatched color) on a system with thousands of colors.</p>
                <h3>Thousands Weep</h3>
                <p>As of this writing, 56% of computer owners now have 16-bit color (thousands of colors), and this probably makes them happy because it makes the daily bikini models’ flesh tones look more realistic. But for web designers, 16-bit color is a nightmare.</p>
                <p>Sure, the dithering in 8-bit (256-color) systems is downright ugly and can make a web page unreadable, but you can avoid it by sticking to the web-safe Color Cube, which thus ends the problem. By contrast, the unavoidable color shifting that occurs on 16-bit systems springs from the dripping maws of Hell.</p>
                <figure>

                        <p>For reasons only a software company could explain, browsers and image editors round off 16-bit color calculations differently. As a result, for users of 16-bit color, image backgrounds and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>), backgrounds will never match (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010302165425/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/beyond" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/beyond/ looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com/storie<wbr>s/beyond/</a>).</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">Say your web page has a web-safe, light brown background color. Say your client’s product shot is supposed to sit on the page. Say the background color in that product shot is subtly "off" from the background of your web page. Say you’re in big trouble, cowboy.</p>
                <p>Due to differences between the way browsers calculate 16-bit color and the way image editors like Adobe Photoshop do it, in the 16-bit color space, browsers are off differently from the way <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images are off. In other words, the background color of the image absolutely, mathematically cannot match the background color of the web page. All the web designer’s careful illusions are revealed. There is nothing you can do about this except wait for 24-bit color to become cheaper so that more consumers will adopt it.</p>
                <p>Some web designers work around this problem by using transparent backgrounds. This is fine as long as the image does not serve also as a link. (Most images these days do.) Why are links problematic? Today most web pages use the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> <span class="orange">hover</span> property to make links light up (meaning change colors) when the visitor drags her mouse over them. As you’ll see in <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">Chapter 3</a>, this kind of visual interactivity is helpful because it lets the user know that this particular set of words can take her somewhere else with a click of her mouse. When images serve as links and when links use the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> <span class="orange">hover</span> property, the background color of a transparent image will change in response to the actions of the visitor’s mouse. Freddie Kreuger has nothing on this unintentional visual effect. Web designers who wish to avoid this horror will either create incredibly complex style sheets or simply use solid, web-safe background colors in their images. And of course, these solid colors will be subtly mismatched on the screens of all 16-bit users. Welcome to the Web. Meantime, at least you can protect your 8-bit, 24-bit, and 32-bit using friends by sticking to the web-safe color palette as often as possible, particularly for large color fields, typography, and background colors.</p>
                <p>At this point many designers scream: "These colors are ugly! This is not what I want." You will find, after you work with these colors, that it is possible to create pleasing combinations with them, and you will develop your own techniques for doing so. We promise.</p>
                <p>When saving images, you do not need to worry about intermediate colors. If your type is web-safe orange, and your background is web-safe blue, the edges of the type will be filled in with intermediately shaded pixels that are probably not web-safe. They do not have to be. As long as the large areas of color are web-safe, a little dithering around the edges of type and images goes unnoticed by most users.</p>
                <p>While <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are an appropriate format for logos, typography, and illustrations, the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format is usually preferred for photography. It is impossible to shift colors to the web-safe palette in a <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>. Again, this limitation of the medium is accepted or ignored by most users. But <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images should generally be shifted as closely as possible toward the Color Cube. In the next sections, we will talk about ways of doing that.</p>
                <h3>Gamma Gamma Hey!</h3>
                <p><em>Gamma</em> is a measurement of light, and different platforms come with different standard gamma settings. The Macintosh has a System Gamma setting of 1.8. Put simply, it looks bright and has a wide range of light-to-dark variance unless Mac users adjust their display to some other setting. Silicon Graphics Machines (<abbr title="Silicon Graphics Machines">SGI</abbr>) have a System Gamma setting of 2.4. Their default output is darker than that of Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>.</p>
                <p>The Windows, Linux, and Sun operating systems run on <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s. <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s and their components are built by a wide variety of manufacturers. While this keeps end-user costs down, it also means that <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s have no standard hardware gamma correction. Typically, their System Gamma is estimated at 2.4—darker than Macintosh. In practice, <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> gamma can be all over the place, but it is always darker than that of Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>.</p>
                <p>What does this mean to web designers? It means that if you do not compensate for this cross-platform gamma variance, the subtle "study in earth tones" that looks so moody and mysterious on your Mac will probably look like a "study in mud" on most <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s. Because <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s are used by at least 90% of your audience, a study in mud is not what you want.</p>
                <p>In the late 1990s, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010405153009/http://www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html" title="Check out what w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html</a>) came up with a gamma standard called standard <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> (sRGB) that gives Windows machines a common gamma setting of around 2.2—at least in theory. Of course, it doesn’t work if users don’t select it. And if they haven’t calibrated their monitors, it still won’t really work. But at least it gives us something to aim for. Windows-based web designers should calibrate their monitors, set their machines to <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr>, and find something else to worry about.</p>
                <p>There are three ways for Mac-based web designers to compensate for gamma issues.</p>
                <p>The simplest is to download and install <em>GammaToggle FKEY</em> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010424120352/http://www.acts.org/roland/thanks" title="Check out what acts.org/roland/thanks/ looked like back in 2001.">www.acts.org/roland/thanks/</a>), a $5.00 shareware control panel created by Roland Gustafsson in the mid-1990s. After it's downloaded and installed in the System folder, this simple control panel allows you to toggle between your Mac gamma setting and a representative <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> gamma setting at the touch of a command key. The software works flawlessly, the $5.00 shareware fee is optional (but how could you not pay the man?), and this tool has proved sufficient for hundreds of thousands of web designers since the earliest days of professional design on the Web. Another advantage to Gamma-Toggle FKEY is that it is software-independent. In other words, you can toggle from Mac to <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> gamma whether you’re working in Photoshop, using a browser, or simply have the kooky urge to push a Command key in the middle of a slow day.</p>
                <p>The second solution is to download the <em>Furbo Filters Webmaster</em> pack (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101122346/http://furbo-filters.com" title="Check out what furbo-filters.com looked like back in 2001.">www.furbo-filters.com</a>), created by Iconfactory’s brilliant Craig Hockenberry with kibitzing from your humble author. Unveiled in 1997, the Furbo Webmaster pack is a constellation of Photoshop plug-ins that (among other things) allows web designers to switch between Mac gamma and three kinds of <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> gamma. The software also lets you preview the effects of various types of <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> compression, and an included Web Scrubber (based on the pioneering efforts of user interface guru Todd Fahrner) lets you selectively shift your images toward the Color Cube. The shareware costs $40, and may be downloaded and used indefinitely for free. A nag screen helps your conscience decide when it’s time to pay for the software.</p>
                <p>In 1998, Adobe got wise to this whole cross-platform gamma issue (and related web design issues) and came out with ImageReady, a Photoshop-like application for creating and exporting web graphics. Like Furbo Filters, ImageReady lets you preview the effects of gamma differences and compression settings on your images, and it also lets you shift your colors closer to or further from the Color Cube.</p>
                <p>In late 1998, with the release of Photoshop 5, Adobe made it possible to compensate for gamma differences between platforms using Photoshop alone. This is largely because Adobe supports the <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr> standard in Photoshop (even on Macs), and Apple supports it through the system’s included ColorSync control panel.</p>
                <p>Mac users, here’s how to put <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr> to work:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Open the <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> Settings preference in Photoshop 5 or higher and select <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr> as your working environment.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Photoshop will prompt you to set up your System Gamma if you have not done so already. In Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> 8 and higher, you can set your Mac’s System Gamma to <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr> using either the Mac’s built-in ColorSync control panel or the Adobe Gamma control panel that comes with Photoshop.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Set your Mac to <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr>, and you will always be inside the Windows gamma space. If you prefer, leave it at typical Mac gamma (or some custom setting), and Photoshop will magically shift your images from the Mac to the Windows color space.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h6>Choose Your Gamma</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>If you continue to design for print as well as the Web, stick with Apple’s default settings and let Photoshop toggle you back and forth between Mac and <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr> gamma settings. If you’re biting the bullet and plunging into full-time web design, by all means set your Mac to <abbr title="standard Red, Green, Blue">sRGB</abbr> and be done with it. After you get used to working inside a slightly darker color space, it will look just fine to you, and you’ll never have to worry about gamma compatibility again.</p>
                </div>
                <p>ImageReady 2.0 is included in Photoshop 5 and higher. Photoshop 5.5 is much more web-savvy than its predecessor, and Photoshop 6 is even more so. We heartily recommend these later versions of Photoshop. If you use an older version, by all means try GammaToggle FKEY or Furbo Filters.</p>
                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>Given what we’ve already discussed in terms of screen, color, and gamma differences, it should come as no surprise that there are vast differences in the way different platforms handle typography on the Web.</p>
                <p>For one thing, different platforms offer different fonts. Two sans serif fonts, Geneva and Helvetica, come standard with Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. Geneva is not found on any other platform, and while Helvetica is available in Linux, it may or may not be present on Windows systems. (Arial is the standard sans serif font that comes with Windows. There is also a version of Geneva that <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr> users can download, and we believe that three or four of them have done so.)</p>
                <p>Confused, yet?</p>
                <h3>The 97% Solution</h3>
                <p>In 1997, Microsoft decided to do something about these typographic differences and commissioned a set of cross-platform web fonts for both Mac and Windows. These include Verdana, a lovely sans serif font designed by Matthew Carter; Georgia, also by Carter, a broad-in-the-beam serif font that can claim a distant kinship with Palatino; and Mac versions of the Windows fonts Arial, Impact, Times New Roman, Courier New, and so on.</p>
                <p>The notion of cross-platform web fonts was a great idea. Unfortunately, not everyone bothered to download and install these fonts, so Microsoft included them in its Internet Explorer browser. (That took care of all the Windows users.) Microsoft then persuaded Apple to make <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> the default browser that comes with the Macintosh Operating System. (That took care of the new Mac users and nearly took care of Netscape.)</p>
                <p>This did nothing for Linux or UNIX users, but it did go a long way toward solving cross-platform font problems because Windows and Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> together make up about 97% of the market. (Depending on how you define the market, anyway.)</p>
                <p>That still left a huge problem unsolved: the difference in typographic resolution between Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> and Windows.</p>
                <h3>Points of Distinction</h3>
                <p>By default in Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, there are 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr>, and a pixel is the same as a point. Thus 12<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. type is 12 pixels tall, 72<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. type is 72 pixels (or one inch) tall, and so on. Of course, most Mac users set their screens to higher resolutions, so this one-to-one equivalency between points and pixels soon becomes meaningless. But 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> is the starting point for Macs.</p>
                <p>Windows users start off with 96<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> resolution; thus, 12<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. type in Windows is 16 pixels tall. Again, this varies according to the user’s choice of screen resolutions, but 96<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> is the starting point.</p>
                <p>In 4.0 (and older) browsers, what looks readable on a Mac looks big and horsey on a Windows <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>. Conversely, what looks tasteful and discrete on a Windows box is often illegibly small on a Mac.</p>

                        <p>Font Wars: In 1997, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> expert Todd Fahrner stuck this image in an obscure corner of the Web. It proved why using points was a brain-dead approach to <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (too bad so few people listened). He sarcastically observed that if things got much worse, Macs would have to use Windows-size typographic defaults. Three and a half years later, Fahrner’s sardonic prediction came true (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20001020200542/http://style.metrius.com/font_size/points/font_wars.GIF" title="Check out what style.metrius.com/font_size/points/font_wars.GIF looked like back in 2001.">http://style.metrius.com/f<wbr>ont_size/points/font_wars<wbr>.GIF</a>).</p>

                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">Particularly since web designers began overcoming their fear of style sheets, Windows-based designers who do not check their work cross-platform have been giving Mac users type they could neither read nor enlarge in the browser. On a <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>, 8<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. type looks swell. On a Mac, it looks like 8 pixels, which is at least 1 pixel shy of legibility.</p>
                <h3>Year 2000—Browsers to the Rescue</h3>
                <p>In 2000, browser makers figured out how to compensate for this long-standing problem. The first to do so was <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 Macintosh Edition, released in March 2000. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac’s default setting is 16<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> type at 96<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> (Windows resolution). The Mac version of Netscape 6, released in November, followed suit.</p>
                <p>In <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac and Netscape 6, users can change their preferences and restore the traditional "Mac" setting for text. By doing so, they risk continuing to be frustrated by the typographic resolution differences between their platform and the dominant Windows <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. But if they’re smart enough to change their settings once, they’re smart enough to change them back again when needed.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac also introduced <em>text zooming</em>, which enables users to enlarge (or shrink) <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> text on the page, no matter how the designer has formatted that text. This liberates web users from web designers’ mistakes and makes the medium more accessible to the visually impaired. Netscape 6 offers similar functionality, though for some reason it was left out of the Macintosh version (at least in the initial Netscape 6 release).</p>
                <p>Of course, 4.0 browsers are still very much among us, and the 18-Month Pregnancy period has only just begun. Consequently, cross-platform font size issues will continue to plague the Web for some time to come. In <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>, "Style Sheets for Designers," we’ll explain how to use style sheets to compensate for all these incompatibilities.</p>
                <h2>Touch Factor</h2>
                <p>When designing a book, your choice of materials and textures is limited only by the client’s budget. When designing a website, you have no textures whatsoever. There is no "touch factor" in work designed for the digital screen. But this lack of sensory input does not mean that the site must be a cold, detached, clinical object. There are many tools to help you bring humanity and warmth to the Web.</p>
                <h3>Appropriate Graphic Design</h3>
                <p>Interactivity can go a long way toward simulating the effect of the "touch." For instance, when you move your mouse over or press the buttons at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102031504/http://www.k10k.net/issue100celebration/22/index.htm" title="Check out what k10k.net looked like back in 2001.">www.k10k.net</a>, they seem to respond to your touch—like buttons in the real world. Intuitive, user-centered navigation helps as well. If the architecture is designed the way users think, navigating the site will be simple pleasure. There will be more on all that in <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">Chapter 3</a>. Smart, appropriate copywriting, which reads the way people talk, also can go a long way toward bringing warmth and humanity to the onscreen experience.</p>
                <p>These approaches enable anyone to create a site that feels like a living entity. Failure to use these tools results in a site that feels cold and dead—high tech, but not high touch.</p>
                <h2>Accessibility, the Hidden Shame of the Web</h2>
                <p>The framers of the Web intended it to be a medium of universal access—a medium whose wealth of information would be accessible to anyone, regardless of physical, mental, or technological disability. Anything that stands in the way of that accessibility is contrary to the purpose of the Web. It is also inhumane, and, as we alluded to earlier, it is now against the law:</p>
                <p>Section 508 of the Workforce Investment Act (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010308185402/http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html" title="Check out what usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html looked like back in 2001.">www.usdoj.gov/crt/508/508law.html</a>) requires all United States Federal Agencies with web-sites to make them accessible to individuals with disabilities. Inaccessible sites can be shut down by the government. In the private sector, inaccessible sites face lawsuits. In 1999, a group of blind citizens successfully sued America Online because its service was not accessible to them.</p>
                <p>How do you design for the blind? It sounds like a paradox, but on the Web it is actually fairly easy.</p>
                <p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101242331/http://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/#gl-device-independence" title="Check out what w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/ looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/TR/WAI-WEBCONTENT/</a>) spell out everything designers must do to make their sites accessible to all.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the things you can do to make your site accessible:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Your <code class="nopad">&lt;IMAGE></code> tags should include <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> text for the benefit of the visually impaired; adding <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> attributes is a good idea as well. <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> and <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> attributes can be spoken by audio browsers used by the blind, so they don’t have to miss out on any content. For example, your web page on the wreck of the <em>Titanic</em> includes a photograph of that ill-fated ship. A bad <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> attribute reads "Image, 24K." Well, what good is that to the disabled user? So your site has an image, so what? A good <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> tag will read "S.S. Titanic." The <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> attribute can provide additional description: "Photograph of the Titanic on her maiden voyage."</span></li>
                    <li><span>If you use frames, include <code class="nopad">&lt;NOFRAMES></code> content in the frameset document. <code class="nopad">&lt;NOFRAMES></code> text shows up in browsers that cannot view frames. Old browsers fall into this category, but so do text browsers such as Lynx and special browsers for the blind. By copying your text and pasting it into the <code class="nopad">&lt;NOFRAMES></code> area, you guarantee that anyone can access the information on your site, even if he or she cannot view your spectacular visual design efforts.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Even if most users will be navigating via snazzy visual menu bars at the top of your site, be sure to include simple <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> links somewhere on the page so that the disabled—or folks with older, non-JavaScript-capable browsers—can still find their way around the site.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>User Knowledge</h2>
                <p>A website must be designed so novice users can find their way through it without trouble. At the same time, a good site offers shortcuts and power tools for more experienced users. How do you serve these two very different audiences at the same time? We’ll discuss that in the very next chapter.</p>
