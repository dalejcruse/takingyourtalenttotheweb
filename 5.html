                <h4>chapter 5</h4>
                <h1>The Obligatory Glossary</h1>
                <p>SEVERAL YEARS BACK, Grey Advertising, Inc. felt it was perceived as a somewhat lackluster agency: large, dependable, and successful at delivering results, but not exactly cutting-edge in a world of Chiats and Weiden-Kennedys (the people who have made commercials for Apple and Nike).</p>
                <p>Grey wanted to enhance its image, and as companies often do, it brought in an outside consultant. A depressing sum of money later, the consultant unveiled this recommendation: <em>make the logo orange</em>. A Grey company with an orange logo, get it? Unexpected. Cutting edge. Fresh. Or so the consultant argued, and the agency apparently agreed.</p>
                <p>The story may be apocryphal, we hasten to add, because Grey has more lawyers than our publisher. We mention the whole thing because, as if Internet terminology itself weren’t confusing enough, job nomenclature at web agencies can be dazzlingly baffling. This is thanks, in part, to consultants who think an orange Grey makes an Apple and "user experience transactional information architect" sounds better than "designer."</p>
                <p>The Web is an insanely great medium. The young industry is exciting and challenging enough to fulfill you through a dozen lifetimes, but the business is so new that even people who work in it get confused over terminology.</p>
                <p>Some companies have a dozen different titles for designers with slightly different jobs; other companies slap one title on everybody, and often enough the title makes little intuitive sense. Orange you Grey we’ve provided this little chapter to help you navigate the twin minefields of Internet buzzwords and ever-changing job titles? You bet you are. (Our apologies to Grey Advertising, consultants everywhere, and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, whom we haven’t offended but just felt like mentioning because it’s a good cause. Besides, if we don’t mention it here, our cats will claw our eyes out—and they can do it.)</p>
                <h2>Web Lingo</h2>
                <h4>Extranet</h4>
                <p>An <em>extranet</em> is a private network of computers that is created by connecting two or more intranets or by exposing an intranet to specific external users and no one else. Business-to-business collaboration often uses extranets.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In English:</span> Extranets are websites that allow Company A to interact with Company B, and Special Customer C to interact with either or both—pretty kinky stuff. As a web designer, you may never be called upon to design an extranet. (If you are, it’s the same thing as designing a website. We’re sorry to bore you with these tedious distinctions, but that’s our job in a section like this. We hear the American Movie Classics cable network is hosting an Alfred Hitchcock retrospective. Maybe you should go watch it until this chapter blows over.)</p>
                <p>On the other hand, the Business-to-Business (<abbr title="Business to Business">B2B</abbr>) category is one of the largest growth areas of the Web, so you may find yourself stuck, er, asked to design extranet sites anyway.</p>
                <p>Websites are websites whether they’re designed for the general public or for private businesses. However, because extranets are business-oriented, they tend to be more like software and less like magazines or television. In other words, the challenges are closer to industrial design and technical design and further from the consumer-oriented design many of us are used to. In still other words, this type of design work is not for everybody, though some designers adore and excel at it. (Excel is a trademark of Microsoft, and even though we didn’t use it in that context in the preceding sentence, their lawyers read everything.)</p>
                <h4><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr></h4>
                <p><em>Hypertext Markup Language</em> (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>) is an application of Standard Generalized Markup Language (<abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>) and is used to construct hypertext documents (web pages).</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In English:</span> <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is to web pages what PostScript is to print. But while Post-Script is a complex programming language, best handled behind the scenes by software such as Illustrator and Quark XPress, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a simple markup language best written by human beings. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> breaks content down into structural components, much as an outline does.</p>
                <p>The simplicity of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> makes it easy to learn, but that simplicity also can be limiting. Soon, many sites will be built with more advanced tools, such as <em>Extensible Markup Language</em> (<abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>). You need not concern yourself with that now. Later on in this book we will show you what <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is, how to use it correctly, and how to employ it creatively. See <a href="8.html" title="Check out chapter 8.">Chapter 8</a>, "HTML: The Building Blocks of Life Itself."</p>
                <h4>Hypertext, hyperlinks, and links</h4>
                <p>For additional information, refer to the section titled, "Website" later in this chapter.</p>
                <h4>Internet</h4>
                <p>The <em>Internet</em> is a worldwide networking infrastructure that connects all variety of computers together. These connections are made via <em>Internet protocols</em> including (surprise, surprise) Internet Protocol (<abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr>), Transport Control Protocol (<abbr title="Transport Control Protocol">TCP</abbr>), and User Datagram Protocol (<abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr>). <abbr title="Internet Protocol">IP</abbr> is used for addresses, <abbr title="Transport Control Protocol">TCP</abbr> is used to manage sockets (and hence the Web), and <abbr title="User Datagram Protocol">UDP</abbr> is used to manage Domain Name Servers (<abbr title="Domain Name Server">DNS</abbr>s). See <a href="4.html" title="Check out chapter 4.">Chapter 4</a>, "How This Web Thing Got Started," for further explanation.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In English:</span> The Internet is to the Web as cable networks are to television or as phone cables and switching stations are to your Uncle Marvin, who always phones while you’re away on vacation and then resents you for not returning his call the very next day. The Internet is a combination of hardware (computers linked together) and software (languages and protocols that make the whole thing work).</p>
                <p>As a web designer, all you need to keep in mind is that you’re not only communicating with readers and viewers ("users" if you must), you’re also creating work that must fit into formats appropriate to Internet technology. In other words, it’s not your job to manage networks (for instance) as long as you understand their implications for your work—such as bandwidth and cross-platform issues. See <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, "Designing for the Medium."</p>
                <h4>Intranet</h4>
                <p>An <em>intranet</em> is an internal or private networking infrastructure that uses Internet technologies and tools. Unlike what occurs on the Internet, only computers on the private physical network can access an intranet.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In English:</span> As a web designer, in addition to creating sites for the public, you also might be called upon to create intranet sites, which are nothing more than websites for private companies. For instance, AT&amp;T not only has websites for the public, it also has thousands of private intranet sites where its employees can communicate with each other, schedule appointments, keep track of company policies, and so on.</p>
                <p>One other difference worth noting is that when you’re designing an Internet site, it has to be usable by anyone in the world—Netscape, Opera, <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>, and iCab users; 6.0 browser users as well as 2.0 browser users; the blind and the not-blind; Web<abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> users and <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr> users alike. You get the picture. On an intranet site, by contrast, all visitors may be using the same web browser and computing platform, which can simplify some of your design choices.</p>
                <p>Of course, even in such circumstances, it is best to design with open standards so that your client will not be locked into restrictive choices. For instance, if you had designed an intranet for a network of Netscape 4 users in 1998, you might have built the entire site using Netscape’s proprietary <span class="orange">LAYERS</span> technology. But with Navigator 6, Netscape stopped supporting <span class="orange">LAYERS</span> in favor of <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards. Had you designed specifically for Netscape’s previous browser, your site would not work when the client upgraded browsers. Clients dislike that sort of thing, even when they are the ones who insisted on using a specific technology. Proceed with caution.</p>
                <p>Additionally, if all the site’s users are connected via a local network, you can make bold use of bandwidth-intensive technologies such as streaming video. When designing for the Web, you need to worry about bandwidth. Full-screen video is out; smaller video images and heavily compressed audio might be okay. For more on this fascinating topic, see Dave Linabury’s "The Ins and Outs of Intranets" at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010207025438/http://www.alistapart.com/stories/inout" title="Check out what alistapart.com/stories/inout/ looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com/stories/inout/</a>.</p>
                <h4>JavaScript, <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr></h4>
                <p><span class="orange">In English:</span> Additional languages of the Web.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">Briefly:</span> <em>JavaScript</em> is a programming language that enables designers or developers to build dynamic interactivity into their sites, further separating the Web from print. <em><abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script</em> is a standardized version of JavaScript. See <a href="11.html" title="Check out chapter 11.">Chapter 11</a>, "The Joy of JavaScript," for more particulars on this topic.</p>
                <p><em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) is a standard that enables designers to control online layout and typography. Like <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, its basics are extremely easy to learn, though its subtleties elude many designers (as well as many browsers). See <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>, "Style Sheets for Designers."</p>
                <p><abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> is a simplified version of <abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr>, designed for use on the Net. As of this writing, it is most often used to deliver database-independent query results between incompatible software applications. It is not yet universally supported in web browsers, though <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> 1 is fully supported in Netscape 6, and much of it is supported in <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5 and Opera 5. As a web designer, at least for the next few years, you will hear about and see <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, but you will not be called upon to create it—unless you begin marking up your web pages in <em>Extensible Hypertext Markup Language</em> (<abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>).</p>
                <p><abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> is essentially an <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> version of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> that works in most browsers. It is currently the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>-recommended markup language for creating sites, though most sites as of this writing are still created in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. The differences between <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, from the "writing the code" point of view, are rather small, like Japan, though the implications of <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> are rather large, like China.</p>
                <p>The <em>Document Object Model</em> (<abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>) is a web standard that lets these other standards "talk to each other" to perform actions. (For more about this, see <a href="11.html" title="Check out chapter 11.">Chapter 11</a>.)</p>
                <p>With the increasing specialization of the Web, designers are no more expected to master all these technologies than Rabbis are expected to fry bacon. Web designers should learn <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (which is easy), and most learn enough JavaScript to be dangerous. Developers rather than designers will likely do the <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> and <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> programming as well as most of the heavy-duty JavaScript/<abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script. The longer you work in the field, the more knowledgeable you will become about these standards, but few employers will expect you to have more than rudimentary awareness of most of this stuff.</p>
                <h4>Web page</h4>
                <p>As explained in <a href="1.html" title="Check out chapter 1.">Chapter 1</a>, "Splash Screen," a <em>web page</em> is a type of electronic document, just as a Microsoft Word file or a Photoshop document is, except that a web page does not require any particular brand of software for someone to open and/or use it. And that is the glory of it, brothers and sisters. Developers and designers build web pages in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> but, as noted above, they also use stuff besides <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, which we’ll talk about in the relevant technical chapters.</p>
                <h4>Website</h4>
                <p>A <em>website</em> is a collection of related web pages published on the World Wide Web.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In English: Click here</span>.</p>
                <h4>Additional terminology</h4>
                <p>Tech terms will come up like last night’s chili burritos throughout your career. You can always look up the latest buzzwords (or refresh your memory about what you have learned) by turning to the Computer Currents High-Tech Dictionary at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010415144611/http://currents.net/resources/dictionary" title="Check out what currents.net/resources/dictionary/ looked like back in 2001.">www.currents.net/resources/dictionary/</a>.</p>
                <h2>Roles and Responsibilities in the Web World</h2>
                <p>As a web designer, you will be responsible for creating the look and feel of websites—or portions thereof. Web designers may create menu bar icons for sites designed by other designers on their team, or they may create animated ad banners for sites designed by others. Hey, you’ve read <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapters 2</a> and <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">3</a>—you know the deal. (If you don’t, read the next chapter, which describes the web designer at painful length.) Meanwhile, this seems as good a place as any to familiarize yourself with some of the other players on your team.</p>
                <h3>Web developer/programmer</h3>
                <p>The web developers on your team will be responsible for the technical implementation of the site. You might hear them talk about Perl, Java, <abbr title="Active Server Pages">ASP</abbr>, <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>, <abbr title="Server Side Include">SSI</abbr>, <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, ColdFusion, and other technologies. Just smile and nod as if you get it.</p>
                <p>Most sites seamlessly fuse design, content, and interactivity. For that to happen, teamwork is needed. You don’t have to understand how developers work their magic any more than developers need to possess design or writing skills. But thoughtful collaboration and mutual respect for each other’s disciplines are required to create functionally and aesthetically superb sites.</p>
                <p>Many developers have their roots in UNIX. Some are old hippies; others look like preteen rejects from the cast of <em>The Matrix</em>. With the frantic need for qualified personnel, developers also might come from the ranks of traditional information technology (<abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>) services. Many of these people are wonderful, but some have a strong bias toward particular technologies and generally do not approach web development with a "Webby" mindset—by which we mean a preference for open standards and accessibility.</p>
                <p>For instance, <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>-trained developers with roots in Microsoft-only shops sometimes employ technologies that leave Mac, Linux, UNIX, and <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>/2 users out in the cold. This is because they don’t know any better; they are as trapped by their training as that sad little boy who shoots puppies. (We now make good on our earlier apology to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. You see, this book is really very skillfully woven together in spite of its strange, dreamlike quality.)</p>
                <p>Before accepting a job, be sure to check the company’s offerings using at least one of these non-Windows operating systems. If the sites fail, the developers may be biased in favor of proprietary technologies without realizing the harmful nature of that predisposition.</p>
                <p>Designers who wish their work to reach the broadest possible audience might want to think twice before accepting a job at a place like that. We’ve even seen shops where Mac-using designers can’t send email due to Windows-only gateway issues. This is not intended as a slam at Microsoft’s many fine products, two of which were used in the creation of this book. It is simply cautionary advice for the job seeker. In our opinion, because closed systems lock out millions of potential users, serious web developers prefer open standards.</p>
                <h4>Project manager</h4>
                <p>These team members are like technologically savvy account executives. They help articulate the client’s needs, develop schedules (timelines) and budgets, and are responsible for keeping the project on track. Just like the account executives you might have worked with in your traditional design career, project managers are usually good people with stressful jobs. As you used to do with account executives, you must employ tact and patience to negotiate with these folks.</p>
                <p>Project managers will often produce things called Gantt Charts, which are frankly little more than fancy work schedules. Say "thank you" when you get these. It makes them feel good about themselves.</p>
                <p>Do not actually look at the Gantt Charts, however. They will only frighten you and make you feel hopeless and uncreative. Don’t worry about missing any deadlines. The project managers will be "casually dropping by" your cubicle every 15 minutes for the next 40 years, and you won’t miss a single deadline. See, what did we tell you? They’re exactly like account executives.</p>
                <h4>Systems administrator (sysadmin) and network administrator (netadmin)</h4>
                <p><em>Sysadmins</em> and <em>netadmins</em> are also called network engineers, database administrators, directors of web development, webgods, UNIX guys, NT guys, Linux guys, and geeks (formerly often called "webmasters")—these are the people who run the server (computer) that houses the site you’re developing. They also run the <em>staging server</em> where you might build the site before actually "publishing" it to the Web.</p>
                <p>In some companies these folks are woefully underpaid juniors with extensive computing knowledge. In others, they’re woefully overpaid juniors without any computing experience at all, which is why many old-school webmasters now call themselves systems administrators, network engineers, database administrators, and so forth, leaving the webmaster moniker to the temp who answers email about the site.</p>
                <p>Most sysadmins are senior employees in charge of a staff. In small companies, they also might be the folks you go to when you need software installed on your computer or if you’re having trouble with your email. In larger companies, an <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> person typically handles those responsibilities. In some companies, sysadmins are also developers and in others, they are not.</p>
                <p>Some companies call their sysadmins <em>developers</em>. Some call their juniors <em>seniors</em>—because titles are easier to come up with than salary. Some say love is like a flower. Don’t let any of this drive you mad. Above all, respect the sysadmins. Without them, we’d have no Web.</p>
                <h4>Web technician</h4>
                <p>Web technicians, also called producers, web producers, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> jockeys, webmonkeys, web practitioners, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> practitioners, design technicians, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> technicians, geeks, and many other things, are folks who do a job similar to that of the studio people in an ad agency. As studio people take an art director’s comp and make technologically-oriented changes to it so that it can be handed off to a printer, web technicians take a web designer’s Photoshop comp, cut it apart, and render it in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and other languages as needed. They also will render the graphic elements in web-appropriate formats.</p>
                <p>If you were wondering, the difference between web technicians and web developers is largely a matter of experience, knowledge, and salary. A web technician may cut your comp apart and write <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; a web developer is more like a technology designer who envisions powerful transactions and writes advanced code in several different languages to bring those visions to life.</p>
                <p>Web developers are as critical to the process as lead designers, whereas web technicians are more like junior designers. Junior designers might create buttons or develop alternate color schemes under the supervision of a senior designer; similarly, web technicians generally do lower-level programming tasks than web developers. Some don’t program at all but simply use cut-and-paste JavaScripts (as do many web designers).</p>
                <p>In smaller companies (or in large companies when there is a time crunch), there are no web technicians; web designers execute their own designs in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, JavaScript, and other languages as needed. This book will prepare you to do that part of the job, making you that much more employable and giving you that much more control over the process. (And as designers, we all like control.)</p>
                <p>Even if you always work in large companies, your knowledge of these processes will enable you to work closely with web technicians, often in a supervisory capacity—as if they were junior designers helping you execute your campaign. It also will enable you to self-publish your creative work if you find, as many of us do, that the Web is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and you have an urge to do creative work even after hours.</p>
                <p>We started this chapter by mentioning that titles are often confusing in this business. The same thing holds for job responsibilities. While there are plenty of junior and mid-level web technicians, there are also web developers who handle these tasks. Regardless of anyone’s stature, it goes without saying that you should be respectful to all your teammates because that makes life better.</p>
                <p>And speaking of you...</p>
                <h2>Your Role in the Web</h2>
