                <h1>Riding the Project Life Cycle</h1>
                <p>IN HOLLYWOOD, THE DIRECTOR IS KING. No matter how brilliant the work of the actors, producers, screenwriter, cinematographer, composer, editor, set designer, or other professionals, when the lights go down it is the director’s vision that fills our eyes and forces us to respond.</p>
                <p>On the Web, compelling sites begin and end with the vision of a lead designer or a small, high-level design team. Other professionals certainly play invaluable roles in defining and executing sites, however. Sites would not work at all without the efforts of information architects, programmers, producers, systems administrators, writers, and quality assurance teams—to say nothing of focus groups, testing groups, marketers, and the occasional consultant. And then there’s the client, who not only foots the bill, but also contributes marketing and product information, existing artwork and promotional materials, and his own ideas.</p>
                <p>But sites that transcend mere adequacy depend on the consistent vision of web designers. That means you.</p>
                <p>Design at this level is broad and deep. It does not end with the creation of graphic design elements. In fact, it does not even begin there. It starts with the first meeting and continues straight through the launch. Under ideal conditions, it goes on to include training and maintenance. For web designers to stay actively involved in every step of the process, they must thoroughly understand how the process works—hence this chapter.</p>
                <p>Make no mistake: If you skip any part of the process, you pay for it later—with a site that falls short of your vision.</p>
                <p>This chapter sketches life in the trenches of web development. It emphasizes the value of a methodology, outlines the life phases of most web projects, and explains the kind of contributions you’ll be expected to make in each phase of the process. Living this life is exciting, rewarding, and sometimes quite stressful. Reading about it is dull as dirt. If you feel like skipping this chapter, we’ll understand. It will be here when you need it. For instance, just before you take your next job.</p>
                <h2>What Is the Life Cycle?</h2>
                <p>Every project, from an ad campaign to the development of a new car, has a life cycle. In most shops, web designers are expected to see a project through from the initial discussion phase to completion and updating. In some shops, this is not required; but in those places, you’ll want to participate anyway.</p>
                <p>If you’re not actively involved in the project from conception to "baby’s first steps," somebody else will be making critical decisions for you. That person may not understand or care about consumer psychology, web usability, or the importance of design. By understanding and involving yourself in the entire project life cycle, you’ll be able to keep the focus on practicalities, aesthetics, the client’s goals, and the needs of the site’s potential audience.</p>
                <p>In your design career, you’ve undoubtedly toiled on projects that were misdirected long before you were brought into the loop. Designers can solve many problems, but they cannot undo fatally misguided business decisions. As an advocate for the end user and a spokesperson for the needs of your team, you must be present from the beginning to the end.</p>
                <p>Some web shops are designer-driven; others have roots in information technology (<abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr>). All good shops recognize the importance of involving the design group early and often. Many web agencies formalize this role of the design group by incorporating it into their methodology.</p>
                <h2>Why Have a Method?</h2>
                <p>All websites, from e-commerce projects to abstract multimedia experiences, contain elements of two types of activities:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Information systems, involving computers and software</span></li>
                    <li><span>Communication design, including advertising and marketing communications</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Because of the size and complexity of today’s sites, web development often resembles information systems projects or enormous advertising and marketing campaigns. It’s not as big a job as coordinating the cast and crew of <em>Gladiator</em>, but it can come surprisingly close.</p>
                <p>Though estimates vary, it’s agreed that the majority of information systems projects fail. In case you missed that, we’ll say it again. Most information systems projects fail. Why do they fail? It’s generally because there is too much stuff to manage and keep track of, including the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Scope (the size of the project)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Budget</span></li>
                    <li><span>Resources</span></li>
                    <li><span>Timelines</span></li>
                    <li><span>Functionality (the stuff the site is supposed to do besides look pretty)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>To help manage such complexity, companies have available to them a resource that reduces the amount of unpredictability and surprise in a project. It is called a methodology. Every good company has one; no two are the same.</p>
                <p>A methodology outlines steps required for a successful project, making sure no steps are missed and none are undertaken at the wrong time. A methodology also organizes these steps into phases. Phases help team members group activities, recognize progress, and notice red flags. A sound methodology provides documented, consistent, proven, repeatable processes. Projects that follow such methodologies work because they avoid reinventing the wheel.</p>
                <p>With a method in place, the team is freed from having to develop unique support tools and processes for each new project. Without a method, the team is driving off-road, blindfolded, without a map. They may reach their destination safely, but it will be six months too late. They may end up in Timbuktu, trying to convince the client they’re in Kansas.</p>
                <p>The following story is true: Once upon a time, a web agency with no methodology agreed to take on a large but fairly simple project. The client delivered the copy 3 months late (they all deliver the copy late). The copy, when delivered, was completely unusable. The agency had to pay a team of freelance writers rush charges out of its own pocket because the client had vetoed a writers budget. The client restructured the entire site as the last graphic elements were being produced, invalidating all development and graphic design work done up to that point and causing everyone to work through Christmas to make up the difference.</p>
                <p>Two weeks before launch, the client changed his logo and corporate colors. A week later he changed his business model. The client faxed revised (atrocious) copy from his vacation home, and it had to be manually retyped, edited by those now-deliriously-happy freelancers, and then put into <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> by freelance web technicians.</p>
                <p>Just before launch, the client’s boss (the <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr>) was brought in to bless the work. Apparently, nobody had apprised him of the project plans. The <abbr title="Chief Executive Officer">CEO</abbr> hated everything. The client halted all work and, fearful of losing his job, refused to send final payment. Attorneys were brought in. Agency staff was laid off to pay the attorneys. Then the freelancers sued the agency for non-payment. More staff was laid off. War was declared in Bosnia; Pinkerton did not return—all because the agency failed to follow a methodology.</p>
                <p>Successful web agencies often fall so in love with their methodology that they broadcast it on their corporate sites. Whether they call it "our method," "our process," or "Uncle Joe," the discussion of corporate methodology is duller than fungus. So why do so many web agencies fill their sites with such wearisome stuff? It’s because clients have been burned when working with web agencies that seemingly had no methodology at all. The trumpeting of methodology carries an implicit promise of performance. ("We won’t be late or over budget. Look! We have a methodology!")</p>
                <p>Every married couple takes vows, but many later break them. Similarly, the existence of a written methodology is no guarantee that the company that wrote it will practice it. Nevertheless, good companies do have methods that work for them, and you will want to master the methodology of your web agency. If possible, you will want to improve it. Every project tests the validity of the company’s methods, thus every project presents an opportunity to improve the company’s methods.</p>
                <h2>We Never Forget a Phase</h2>
                <p>Like all human endeavors, web projects may be broken down into phases. Each phase involves particular, predictable activities and results. We’re not speaking of the mysterious spark of creative inspiration here; we’re talking about process and workflow. Breaking a web project into phases allows companies to predict and plan for activities, ensuring that no steps are skipped. Reusing processes from one project to another also increases efficiency while reducing heartache, phone rage, and legal expenses.</p>
                <p>Phases are plans, and plans are never static. Over the life of any project, activities move from one phase to another; activities may span several phases; and lines of delineation between phases may blur. Still, it is possible to sketch a general outline of the web project life cycle, which is what we’ve done here.</p>
                <p>The five phases of site development are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Analysis</span></li>
                    <li><span>Design</span></li>
                    <li><span>Development</span></li>
                    <li><span>Testing</span></li>
                    <li><span>Deployment</span></li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Analysis (or "Talking to the Client")</h3>
                <p>In this phase, you will meet with the client as often as necessary to fully understand what the client wishes to achieve with the project, to determine the best ways of meeting those needs, and to sell those solutions to the client. You’ll also continually interface with fellow team members to make sure these solutions make sense and can be executed.</p>
                <p>Even before sitting down to brainstorm with the team, you must help the client articulate and clearly define the site’s goals. Is the site selling something? If so, what is being sold and to whom? Is the site intended to serve as a portal—if so, a portal to what and for whom? How will this portal differ from its competitors? If the idea stinks, don’t be afraid to say so. (First, of course, do enough homework to be certain that the idea really stinks and be prepared to offer the client a better idea.)</p>
                <p>These responsibilities are not the web designer’s alone. Project managers, information architects, and marketing folks will be all over these meetings, but the web designer plays an essential part.</p>
                <p>Indeed, the web designer is often the only person in the room who even thinks about the end user. The project manager is scheming ways to get the project done on time. The programmer is itching to try out some new technology or lazily conceiving ways to reuse code from the previous project. The technology director is fretting about server farms. The junior designer is nursing a hangover, and the client is lost in fantasies of market domination.</p>
                <p>The web designer must help the client articulate objectives, both broad and narrow, to begin delineating the project’s scope. If this work is not done up front, it will haunt the project (and the whole team) later on.</p>
                <p>In these early meetings, the web designer should be prepared to discuss possible site structuring options, technological baselines, and related issues. Even if these ideas change later in the process—and they will—the web designer must be comfortable articulating possible solutions "on the fly." This begins establishing a client comfort level, which will be essential throughout the process. If the client does not trust the web designer in the beginning of the cycle, the project will begin to self-destruct further down the line.</p>
                <p>To summarize what we’ve just said: It is essential that the web designer possess the ability to understand a client’s marketing goals and to discuss potential issues and solutions with regard to design, site architecture, and technology.</p>
                <p>To assuage your fears, the only part of this that is new (from your perspective as a professional designer) is that technological issues have been added to the equation—much as ink, paper stocks, and such are part of the traditional design equation. You will learn what you need to know in this book and on the job.</p>
                <h4>The early phase</h4>
                <p>Earlier, we urged you to get involved at the very beginning of the process. There is one phase in which you cannot participate. That is the client’s own analysis phase. You will not meet with your clients until they’ve sat down first to figure out their needs. Ninety-nine times out of ninety-nine, those needs will change once you’re involved in the process.</p>
                <p>How does the analysis phase operate? Just as in traditional design projects, it typically begins at the highest levels of detail and works its way down. In initial meetings, the focus is on broad strokes (such as, "We’re a community for young women."). As the project progresses, lower-level decisions emerge (such as, "Should we put buttons or text labels on tertiary search results pages?").</p>
                <p>Though most of us are happiest alone in our cubicles, staring at our monitors and though many of us would rather undergo gum surgery than face another meeting, in many ways this phase is the most critical and creative part of the job. The movement, over successive meetings, from the general to the particular takes place on many levels and extends beyond issues of graphic design and technology.</p>
                <p>Many times, even the most sophisticated clients have only a rudimentary and confused idea of what they wish to achieve. In their own realm, they are kings. On the Web, they are lost little children. If your background includes marketing experience and if you have made yourself knowledgeable about the Web, you can guide your clients away from vague or even nonsensical plans and toward worthwhile, achievable goals.</p>
                <p>Take a simple project. Your client wants to sell videotapes online. He has lined up a supplier and a fulfillment house, and after a full two hours of online experience, he is convinced that his site will be "the Yahoo meets <abbr title="America Online">AOL</abbr> of online videotape e-tailing," whatever that means. Because his daughter, an art major, showed him the Monocrafts site (<a href="//www.yugop.com" title="Check out yugop.com.">www.yugop.com</a>), a brilliant and beautiful work done entirely in Flash, he figures his site should have "something like that" as well—oh, and a chat room. He read about those in an airline magazine while flying between Seattle and New York last year. He then describes the in-flight movie.</p>
                <p>We wish we were making this stuff up, but it happens all the time. Not that this client is necessarily an idiot—he may be brilliant in his accustomed sphere of business. He may even read French literature and know fine wines. It’s just that the Web is a mystery to him, and he’s not used to admitting ignorance on any subject, even to himself. With tact and kindness, you and your team will guide him toward a workable plan. Six months from now, if you do your job well, he may have a fine site that includes movie reviews by Roger Ebert, streaming video clips of selected films, and a thriving movie lovers’ discussion area. But it can happen only if you work with him during the sometimes painful early analysis phase.</p>
                <h4>Defining requirements</h4>
                <p>Before all else, the web team must define two types of requirements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><strong>Technical.</strong> These include anticipated performance, bandwidth, security issues, and so on.</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Business.</strong> These include needs and constraints (having to accommodate first-time web users), as well as overall marketing objectives.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>These requirements are summarized in documents with impressive-sounding names such as "Functional Spec," "Requirements Document," or the ever popular "Use Cases Document." And the fun doesn’t stop there: parent documents beget baby documents—all of which will be used to guide initial development, and none of which are carved in stone. The more stuff you figure out, the more you realize you have yet to figure out. Digital projects kill more trees than the Daily News. You will be buried in paper. Read it, absorb it, and set it aside.</p>
                <p>Happy families are all alike, but every web project is different. Generally, though, the purpose of early analysis is to define goals, determine constraints and requirements, and establish trust. Without goals, constraints, and requirements, it will be impossible to know if the project is on target. Without trust, you are looking at months of sheer Hell. With trust in place, you may still be looking at months of sheer Hell, but you have a better shot at enjoying the process and creating something useful.</p>
                <p>If this sounds familiar, it should. The only difference between analysis in traditional design and analysis in web design is the medium itself. Instead of die-cuts or film transfers, you’ll be discussing bandwidth and browsers.</p>
                <h6>How it Works: Analysis in Action</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>Dishes Plus is a regional chain of successful retail outlets, known for its reasonable prices, wide variety, and "break proof" guarantee. Dishes Plus has decided to sell its product online. Naturally, you learn about the company’s existing business, its competitors, and its brand image before the meeting. You and your team help Dishes Plus define large goals (selling dishes), small goals (branching out into soup tureens), and in-between goals (establishing a bridal registry division).</p>
                    <p>You find out about the company’s audience (mostly women/mostly men, young/old, urban/rural) and sketch the impact that may have on technological and design considerations. If Dishes Plus has a loyal audience of people over 50, tiny type is out, and plug-in based multimedia is probably out as well. If selling is key, technological considerations leap to the forefront and should be examined carefully.</p>
                    <p>How many clicks from expression of interest to final sale? If the inventory is vast, a search engine will be needed. If Dishes Plus shoppers tend to spend hours poring over the goods, artificial intelligence may be called into play on searches ("If you like the Dixie Deluxe Classic Set, you’ll love the Colonel’s Tea Service").</p>
                    <p>Does Dishes Plus anticipate an overseas market? You might need to consider building the site in several languages and using iconography to facilitate navigation by non-English speakers. Do details matter? You can’t assume that the client’s photography is up to snuff. You may need to budget for a good shooter, conversion from photography to digital images, and a database to store and serve the relevant images.</p>
                    <p>How does the database work? Your developers know. Meet with them separately and then bring one or more to the next client meeting.</p>
                    <p>The possibilities are endless—when you first enter the room. After several successful analysis meetings, the possibilities should have focused into a set of meaningful and achievable goals. If you’re still talking in generalities after two or three meetings, you’re not doing your job. If you’re talking in generalities after four or five meetings, the client is not serious. Timelines with cash consequences can sober up most clients. Have an attractive, friendly project manager explain to the client the additional costs incurred as his indecisiveness causes deadlines to shift.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>The design phase is a simple word for a heck of a lot of activity. The process nearly always unfolds something like this:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Brainstorm and problem solve with your team.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Translate needs into solutions.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Sell ideas to the client.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Identify color comps to be developed.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Create color comps and proof of concept.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Present color comps and proof of concept.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Revise and repeat as necessary.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Receive design approval.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Brainstorm and problem solve</h4>
                <p>As soon as your team has a clear understanding of the client’s business problems, goals, constraints, and requirements, you can begin brainstorming solutions on your own, in partnership with other web designers, and in meetings with developers, producers, and information architects.</p>
                <p>A project manager will join the team if she has not already done so. Make her your best friend. While you conceive grand notions or are daydreaming in Adobe Illustrator, she will be keeping track of and documenting schedules, deadlines, goals, and progress. We wouldn’t last a minute in her job. Nor would most "creative" folks. Respect her for doing what you would pay not to do.</p>
                <p>Methods of brainstorming vary. Some groups like to shout out ideas, writing everything down on a whiteboard. Others like to go off in small groups and then reassemble to critique each other’s ideas. Sometimes you sit in the corner and type out ideas. Sometimes you draw on a traditional sketchpad. Some agencies dictate how the process should work; others let you figure it out for yourself.</p>
                <h4>Translate needs into solutions</h4>
                <p>The web designer and other team members will collectively come up with a number of solutions, which will then be narrowed down by group consensus, creative director fiat, or both. These solutions may be articulated internally through any combination of rough design sketches, internal Photoshop comps, written documents, or <em>wireframes</em> (functional visual storyboards showing the proposed site elements in relation to each other, but not in any way indicating how they will eventually look and feel).</p>
                <p>To present these ideas to the client, you can once again use any of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Rough design sketches</span></li>
                    <li><span>User interface documents</span></li>
                    <li><span>Creative briefs</span></li>
                    <li><span>Pencil sketches</span></li>
                    <li><span>Wireframes</span></li>
                    <li><span>Color comps</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h4>Sell ideas to the client</h4>
                <p>Using any or all of the tools just listed, the team presents their projected solutions to the client, answering questions, justifying decisions and methods, and discussing alternatives. As part of this discussion and "selling" process, the designer should be able to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><strong>Articulate technology limitations.</strong> Explain why the team supports a particular solution and avoid committing to alternatives that won’t work.</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Articulate design considerations and decisions.</strong> As in a traditional design project, explain the rationale behind various creative decisions.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Articulating the limitations of technology and the needs of users can be tricky. The web designer must be familiar with technological issues involved in web development to be able to explain why the team supports a particular solution and to prevent <em>impossible</em> agreements and commitments.</p>
                <p>Impossible agreements occur when the client asks for something that cannot be done, cannot be done within the budget and time frame, or just plain <em>should</em> not be done—and an inexperienced web designer or project manager commits the company to fulfilling that unreasonable or impossible expectation. Don’t laugh. Plenty of web design teams have met their doom by committing to solutions that are technologically or graphically inappropriate, more costly than they’re worth, impossible to deliver within the given time frame, or simply deeply stupid.</p>
                <p>We were once asked to design the interface for a sophisticated, multi-user business software program that ran in a web browser. Essentially, the product was an intranet site with advanced functions rivaling that of expensive proprietary software. Though a sales force had lined up dozens of large corporate buyers, the developers were unable to deliver the product because its scope kept shifting as the executive in charge came up with one "neat idea" after another that he insisted on incorporating into the product. The design team and sales force sat on their hands while the developers burned out trying to fulfill constantly shifting objectives.</p>
                <p>The executive then decided that the seemingly undeliverable product would sell better if users could visually customize it to their liking. He asked that a series of "skins" be developed, and the project manager added this requirement to the mountain of unattained goals. The last we heard, the product was still in development.</p>
                <p>This kind of foolishness most often takes place in-house, where egos run unchecked and projects can drag on forever without obvious financial consequences—because those who do the work are on the company payroll anyway. But it also can creep into traditional client-vendor relationships if project managers accept impossible agreements.</p>
                <p>That’s the worst-case scenario. The only-slightly-better scenario is that your company will somehow fulfill the impossible agreement only to watch the client fail because everyone shook hands over a really bad idea. The client may want his e-commerce site visitors to enter personal data and create a unique user account before even seeing what he has to offer. He may request this at the last minute, and the web agency may manage to fulfill the request on time and within the budget. But nobody will use the site, and the client could bad-mouth the agency rather than admit his own folly, thus harming your business for years to come.</p>
                <p>Even if the client has only good things to say about you, you don’t want your clients to fail, and you don’t want the press to associate your agency with widescreen, Technicolor flops. It will take all your expertise at client negotiation to avoid the Titanic effect (also known as the <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010405052728/http://www.boo.com/home_hr.asp" title="Check out what Boo.com looked like back in 2001.">Boo.com</a> effect). But it’s better to face conflict than to knowingly deliver bad work.</p>
                <p>The best-case scenario, of course, is to come up with and sell workable solutions that offer real value to the audience your client wishes to reach.</p>

                <div class="h6">
                    <p>"Because I know what I’m doing, and you’re a pathetic marketing flack who wouldn’t know a good idea if it bit him on the thigh."</p>
                </div>
                <h6>How to Do It</h6>
                <div class="h6">
                    <p>"We considered that very solution, Burt, but these studies show it would take 50% more time than we have—and we found that companies who tried that technique actually did worse than companies who did it the way we’re suggesting. Marcie, could you show Burt that Tragic Failure Report you were sharing with me before the meeting?"</p>
                </div>
                <p>A good web designer will sometimes lie in the service of a larger truth. Pretend we didn’t say that, and we’ll pretend you don’t know exactly what we’re talking about.</p>
                <p>Selling your ideas is not limited to unselling bad ideas, of course. And it’s also not limited to explaining technology. You’ll have the same design and brand identity discussions you’ve been having for years. They still want the logo bigger. They still prefer the obvious to the original. They still know just enough to be dangerous to themselves and the project.</p>
                <h4>Identify color comps</h4>
                <p>You’ve finally determined the direction; in this phase, you figure out what the client needs to see next. Typically, you’ll be creating comps of the website’s front page and one or two internal pages. These comps are not functional web pages; they are simply realistic renderings. At the same time, you (or you and an information architect) will be developing storyboards or wireframes outlining the flow of the site, from front page to order form, from bulletin board to help page. You will not comp all these pages; you simply need to know how they work.</p>
                <h4>Create color comps/proof of concept</h4>
                <p>Having identified the color comps necessary to prove the site concept, you execute them in Photoshop or another design tool. Today’s web pages almost always interact with the visitor—changing in response to mouse movements and other events. Representing those interactive changes in a comp may sound like a challenge, but it’s really not.</p>
                <p>For instance, on most sites, an icon or menu item will change appearance when the visitor’s cursor rolls over that icon. This change in appearance, not surprisingly, is called a rollover. A comp can demonstrate the active rollover state by showing one icon that is different from the others ("rolled over"). To make the effect crystal clear, capture an image of a mouse cursor and lay it on top of the "active" icon in Photoshop (Figure 7.1).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="7.1.png" alt="Figure 7.1" width="517" height="61" class="large-6 columns">
                    <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                        <h6>Figure 7.1</h6>
                        <p>Is this a screenshot of an active rollover on a web page? Or is it a Photoshop comp? Only its hairdresser knows for sure.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h4 class="clearfix">Present color comps and proof of concept</h4>
                <p>You have presented, articulated, and sold ideas to the client. Now you do it again. The only difference is that the work is farther along in the process. In addition to explaining the rationale behind design decisions and discussing the underlying technology, you also should be prepared to aurally "sketch" what you have not yet comped up.</p>
                <p>The client is interested not only in what you are showing; she is equally interested in what you are not showing. "Are all the sub-pages like this one? Will there be photographs on the message board pages, as there are on the content pages? What happens if the search shows up empty? What will that page look like? Does my hair look okay?"</p>
                <p>You need to satisfy the client by describing (or "verbally storyboarding") these non-rendered pages. Prepare in advance. After all, you need to know this stuff as badly as the client does. By having your answers ready, you’ll shorten the approval process when it comes time to design the next stage. (Client: "Oh, right, that’s the area we said would have the yellow menu bar. Now I remember.") You also will further instill client confidence in the design team.</p>
                <p>After the presentation, you will almost certainly need to make modifications. Web clients are no different than other design clients. They all have needs they can’t quite articulate until they’ve seen some work. As in your current job, you must know the difference between minor changes, which may actually enhance the site, and major changes that could throw the entire project off course. It is your responsibility to communicate the full impact of suggested changes.</p>
                <p>The presentation and revision process can go several rounds, demanding your tact as well as your expertise. You must be able to respond positively to client requests and return with a solution that demonstrates your responsiveness, without jeopardizing the end product.</p>
                <h4>Receive design approval</h4>
                <p>The great day arrives! The client has signed off (well, except for one more teeny tiny change). Now you gear up to begin translating your concept into reality. This phase is known as development.</p>
                <h3>Development</h3>
                <p>In the development phase, web designers work with other team members to translate site concepts into functional web pages. While you design additional graphic elements, create Style Sheets, and possibly code web page templates in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and JavaScript, producers will be marking up dozens, hundreds, or thousands of pages, and developers will be working to make the entire site far more functional than <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> alone allows.</p>
                <p>Up until now, you’ve felt pretty certain about the way the site would shape up. After all, the front page and selected sub-pages have been designed and approved. Now, you must take the elements of all those pages and apply them to every single page of the site. Sometimes you do all this work; sometimes assistants or colleagues pitch in; and sometimes the work is carried out by the equivalent of production artists, whose work you may supervise. What is important in this phase is to maintain consistency.</p>
                <p>Is the navigational menu on the right-hand side in all existing comps? Then it should remain there as new pages are designed, unless there is an overwhelmingly important reason to move it. ("It doesn’t fit on this page" is not a legitimate rationale; it merely means you must work harder and rethink that page. Sometimes it means you must rethink the entire site.) The consistent location of navigational elements provides a vital pathfinder for visitors. Imagine trying to find your way in a strange city where the street signs kept changing color or location. No city would be that cruel or foolish. Neither should any website. (Flip back to <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">Chapter 3</a>, "Where Am I? Navigation & Interface," for more on this subject.)</p>
                <p>Client-branding elements also must be treated with consistency from page to page. There are technological reasons for this, as well as psychological ones.</p>
                <p>Psychologically, if the logo is always 32 x 32 pixels and always at the top left, visitors expect to see it there on all pages. Such consistency reassures visitors that they are still in the same "place" on the Web. After all, the Web is a fluid and limitless medium, and the client’s site is just a drop in that vast ocean. Consistent branding orients web users; inconsistent branding disorients them. Love your audience and provide the markers they need to know where they are (and your clients will think you’re doing it for them).</p>
                <p>Technologically, once a graphic element is cached in the visitor’s browser, it need not be downloaded again. Because most visitors use slow dialup modems, the less downloading, the faster the site and the better the user experience. Thus, if the same 32 x 32 image appears on every page, there is no need for additional downloads, and each page of the site will appear that much faster. (Refer to the discussion in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, "Designing for the Medium," regarding bandwidth and caching if you’ve forgotten how this works or why it matters.)</p>
                <p>During the development phase, you’ll do things such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Create all color comps</span></li>
                    <li><span>Communicate functionality</span></li>
                    <li><span>Work with templates</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>We provide tips and pointers in the following sections.</p>
                <h4>Create all color comps</h4>
                <p>As you have seen, the design phase demanded the creation of selected color comps. During development, one or more web designers will create color comps for all pages. Depending on client expectations, the design team also may show these comps to the client for approval.</p>
                <p>As the team creates each color comp, technicians or junior designers will cut it apart in Adobe ImageReady or Photoshop 6, Macromedia Fireworks, or another similar software program. This process converts the color comp into component elements, and these are finally assembled into a working web page built with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and other web languages or with a <em>What You See Is What You Get</em> (<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) web layout program, such as Dreamweaver. This is not the only way to create web pages, nor (in our opinion) is it necessarily the best way. It is the primary technique used in most shops, however, and every web designer should master the process.</p>
                <h4>Communicate functionality</h4>
                <p>Refer to the previous discussion on rollovers or <em>image swapping</em>, as it can be called. In some web firms, the web designer will code those image swaps in JavaScript. In other firms, the web designer merely articulates a desired effect (complete with Photoshop comps), and a developer or web technician writes the necessary code.</p>
                <p>Functionality can include <abbr title="Common Gateway Interface">CGI</abbr> and Java (for forms, e-commerce, message boards, and chat functions), JavaScript (for special interactive visual effects as well as less glamorous browser detection, plug-in detection, forms validation, and so on), plug-in technologies (Flash, QuickTime, or RealVideo), and beyond.</p>
                <p>The communication travels both ways. At times the technologist will explain intentions or limitations to the web designer; at other times the web designer calls the shots. Web designers are not expected to know Java programming or MySQL. Many web designers do not even work in Flash. What’s expected is that you know enough about these formats and languages to work with those who specialize in them, articulating your vision or responding to the direction of others.</p>
                <p>By the way, we despise the word "functionality" even more than we hate phrases such as <abbr title="Business to Business">B2B</abbr> or <abbr title="Business to Consumer">B2C</abbr>. Alas, it seems to be the best word for the job. Former English majors, check your emotions at the door. This business has more buzzwords than a venture capitalist convention.</p>
                <h4>Work with templates</h4>
                <p>In some cases, sites change very little over time. More commonly, the site you design functions as a placeholder or shell for ever-changing content. Sometimes this changing content is managed by the web agency. If the client updates infrequently, you can simply write new <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and create new images to accommodate occasional changes like these. More often, your clients will update their own sites, with mixed results. (We’ll be whining about that later in the book.)</p>
                <p>Today, content is often changed dynamically, by means of various backend technologies. In such cases, you are not so much designing pages as you are templates—visual and markup placeholders in which content will be updated by means of a publishing system or in response to dynamic database technology. The work is essentially the same as "traditional" web design but involves special considerations that will be articulated by the technologists on the team. (See <a href="12.html" title="Check out chapter 12.">Chapter 12</a> for more.)</p>
                <h4>Design for easy maintenance</h4>
                <p>In the best of all possible worlds, the web design team retains control over the site as it evolves over the months and years. Control is usually accompanied by a retainer fee, which is negotiated at the very beginning of the process. In reality, more and more clients assume control over the site when it is delivered.</p>
                <p>Designers and coders should always create highly structured and well-documented work, so that they can easily go back to it and update it without hunting for missing files, debugging errant file references, and so on (or so that their clients, upon assuming control of the site, can perform these tasks without damaging the site).</p>
                <p>Upon finishing the site, you’ll accompany it with a style guide and documentation. These will be much easier to create if the site’s file structure and naming conventions make sense to begin with.</p>
                <p>For you, this means titling the logo image "logo.gif" instead of "uglyswirl-withstupidbevel.gif," calling the November header graphic "nov_head.gif," and so on. For the web technician (or you, if you write your own <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>), this means naming the disclaimer page "disclaimer.html," storing images in a single directory labeled "Images," and so on.</p>
                <p>If care is taken throughout the development process, then updating and maintaining the site will be easy and logical, whether updates are performed by you, a production person, or your client.</p>
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>Though a web development team will test its product throughout the project life cycle, many web projects plan for a distinct testing phase. In this phase, the development team has the opportunity to test the deliverable against the design and functionality specifications.</p>
                <p>In some cases, real users may test a site. In other cases, a specially trained testing team will do the job. Testing by real users usually tells you more about the site. We often get the most useful feedback by showing work to the guys who deliver sandwiches. Be elitist in choosing typefaces but democratic in designing interfaces. The Web is for people, not for experts.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the testing technique involved, team members must work together to track down the source of problems and implement solutions.</p>
                <p>We guarantee that there will be problems. For one thing, no two web browsers interpret code and markup exactly the same way (see <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>). For another, what seems clear to you may be baffling to the people who use your site. Web designers tend to live two years ahead of the curve; web users, who actually <em>have lives</em>, tend to live behind the curve. You know that little rotating box takes visitors back to the home page; visitors may not. Testing will reveal problems in browser compatibility and user acceptance; then it’s up to you and your team to solve those problems.</p>
                <h3>Deployment</h3>
                <p>You’ve completed the site. The client has signed off on it. The files have been transferred to the web server. Think you’re finished? Not quite yet. Successful projects demand a smooth transition from the web team to the client.</p>
                <h4>The updating game</h4>
                <p>In the early days, clients viewed the web designer as a species of magician. They knew they had to have a web presence, whatever that meant, and they felt that you held their fate in your hands. Not only were they eager to approve what you created (because it was all magic to them), they also were more than willing to retain you as the perpetual updater and refresher of their online identity.</p>
                <p>Then came FrontPage, GoLive, and Dreamweaver—tools that theoretically let "anybody make a website," whether they knew what they were doing or not. Now, the possession of FrontPage does not turn your client into a web designer any more than ownership of a Roland Drum Machine turns the neighbor’s kid into Keith Moon. But the ability to generate <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the language with which web pages are created, has convinced too many clients that they can save a buck or two by purchasing one of these web-editing tools and updating their sites themselves. The results are often disastrous, for reasons that will be obvious to any creative professional, but incomprehensible to many clients, whose esthetic sensibilities have been shaped by cooking up pie charts in PowerPoint. Not that we’re bitter.</p>
                <p>There are several ways to manage the transition. In one of the better scenarios, you’ve designed a database-generated site for a large client with much money and created a custom publishing tool enabling them to add fresh content to the mix without befouling the site.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, instead of providing clients with a custom publishing tool, you might hook them up with an existing product, such as Zope (www.zope.org) or Allaire Spectra (www.allaire.com). Some of these tools use standard web languages such as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>; many use custom markup and are part of larger proprietary product families. Some are simple enough for a client to use; others require considerable developer involvement, which is one way of keeping your finger in the pie—if that’s your idea of fun. What you gain in billings you may lose in <abbr title="Information Technology">IT</abbr> people, who quit from the frustration of continually guiding clients through complex processes requiring specialized knowledge. This, however, is your boss’s worry, not yours (unless you own the web agency).</p>
                <p>In still other cases, your client will assign an in-house person or team to take over the site. Sometimes these folks are in-house designers with solid web experience. Sometimes they’re overworked marketers with a copy of FrontPage.</p>
                <p>Regardless of how the site is updated and by whom, in this final phase of development, you get one more opportunity to preserve your work and serve your client by creating documentation, providing client training, and maintaining contact on a consulting basis.</p>
                <h4>Create and provide documentation and style guides</h4>
                <p>"Care and Feeding" instructions accompany everything from puppies to houseplants, and websites demand the same loving attention. It is important to provide the client with detailed notes on the location of files, the fonts and color palettes used, photographers or illustrators involved, and so on.</p>
                <p>As more and more clients plunge into the business of updating their own sites, it is vital to provide them with every possible scrap of information. If you don’t take pains with this postpartum part of the process, your client may paint a mustache on your Mona Lisa or send visitors running for their lives when a Style Sheet or JavaScript file is accidentally deleted.</p>
                <p>Remember: A book design is a book design, a finished ad is a finished ad, but a website is never finished, and the client can always louse it up. Do everything in your power to save your clients from themselves.</p>
                <p>By the way, such documentation should be created even if the web agency retains control of the project (including updating and maintenance). After all, six months from now, do you really want to scratch your head trying to remember which font you used, where your navigational menu graphics were stored, or which script was responsible for a given function? Of course not. This documentation will be easier to create, and the site will be easier to update if you’ve followed the advice given earlier in this chapter and <em>designed for easy maintenance</em> by establishing and following logical naming and structural conventions.</p>
                <h4>Provide client training</h4>
                <p>Sometimes it is enough to tell your clients which fonts and colors you used. Sometimes it is enough to tell your children not to play with matches. Usually, it is not enough. That’s why, whenever possible, the designer and other team members should have after-meetings to discuss the site in detail and provide as much client training as possible.</p>
                <p>Besides helping the client avoid ruining a beautiful site, in-house training also sends the message that your company cares. Clients who know you care will come back with additional projects and will tell their friends on the golf course about the integrity of your company.</p>
                <p>If your clients are going to be writing <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or (bless us) creating new images, it is worth sitting down with them, at their computer or yours, and pointing out the fine nuances of what you’ve done. You might even buy fonts for them (matching the fonts you used), install the fonts on the client’s computer, and show them how to work with Extensis Suitcase or Adobe Type Manager Deluxe.</p>
                <p>You may feel ludicrous doing this, especially if the client is not a graphic designer, but it’s foolish to underestimate other people’s creative potential. Besides, if they’re going to do the work anyway, you owe them and yourself every possible assistance.</p>
                <p>This whole thing is fairly unsavory, we’re afraid. It’s rather like a dentist training patients to extract their own teeth, but it is an aspect of the business, and coping is better than lamenting.</p>
                <h4>Learn about your client’s methods</h4>
                <p>Training is often bi-directional. While explaining your methods to an in-house peer (or turning a client into a junior web designer of sorts), you also should learn as much as you can about the way your client will work with the site. If possible, you should learn about the software your client will be using. It’s highly unlikely that your client will create <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and other web markup by hand. Fortunately, the number of <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> web editors considered good enough to use is fairly limited, so you can learn the basics and pitfalls of your client’s software of choice even if you never touch the stuff yourself.</p>
                <p>We recently ran into a puzzling problem where the web typography we had established via Style Sheets kept disappearing from the client’s site after he took it over. We had written a Global Style Sheet, placed it in a secure location, and instructed the client never to touch it. Yet every time he updated the front page, the Style Sheet reverted to an early, inferior vision, and the client was constantly contacting us to ask why the site was going to Hell.</p>
                <p>Eventually we discovered that a site maintenance feature built into the client’s software was the culprit behind the Case of the Changing Style Sheet. When the client updated his index page, his software program asked if he wanted to "upload related files." Because that sounded like a pretty good idea, the client always clicked Yes. The program then automatically uploaded dozens of files from his hard drive to the server. An old Style Sheet on his hard drive was automatically replacing the newer one we had created. We re-sent him the updated Style Sheet, instructed him to turn off the site maintenance feature, and from then on, all was well.</p>
                <h2>Work the Process</h2>
                <p>The process you’ve just read about varies by agency, but the general outlines and the lessons involved should hold true for most companies and projects. Some agencies keep themselves fairly aloof from their clients and manage to do wonderful work in spite (or because) of it. Others become deeply involved with their clients, establishing long-lasting, trust-based relationships.</p>
                <p>Some hold their clients to ironclad contracts and schedules, while others are loose and almost playful in their approach. Some shops show the client exactly one comp—take it or leave it. Others cover the walls. Some agencies charge astronomical fees merely to write a proposal; others write proposals, design comps, and create storyboards on spec—a terribly ill-advised approach, but not as rare as it ought to be.</p>
                <p>The main thing to remember is that every phase, every step of the process, is potentially empowering. If you use initial meetings to establish trust and help sharpen the client’s vision, you will find yourself working on sites worth designing—for clients who respect you instead of mistrusting and fighting with you. If you use the design phase to fully explore possibilities, you will come up with richer designs and avoid structural problems in the implementation phase. If you cooperate with team members and your client during the production phase, you will encounter fewer problems during testing. If you train your clients respectfully, your best efforts will be preserved, you’ll be able to look at your old sites without experiencing nausea, and the credibility of your work will win you new and better projects.</p>
