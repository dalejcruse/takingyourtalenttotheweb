                <h1><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the Building Blocks of Life Itself</h1>
                <p>AS WE’VE SAID THROUGHOUT THIS BOOK, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a simple language for creating documents that adhere to structured outlines.</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;h1>Headline&lt;/h1><br> 
                            <span class="extraleft">&lt;h2>Subhead&lt;/h2></span><br>
                        &lt;p>Paragraph.&lt;/p><br> 
                        &lt;p>Second paragraph.&lt;/p><br> 
                        &lt;p>Third paragraph.&lt;/p><br>
                            <span class="extraleft">&lt;h3>Subordinate subhead&lt;/h3></span><br>
                        &lt;p>Paragraph.&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;p>Second paragraph.&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;p>Third paragraph.&lt;/p><br>
                        &lt;address>Contact information, copyright, date of publication&lt;/address>
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>Rocket science it’s not, nor was it intended to be. All great ideas should be this simple. Notice that the tags (that’s what the lines are called—tags) suggest their functions: <code class="nopad">&lt;p></code> for paragraph, <code class="nopad">&lt;h1></code> for first-level headline, <code class="nopad">&lt;address></code> for contact information. Notice also the fine symmetry in this simple example. You open a <code class="nopad">&lt;p></code> and you close it <code class="nopad">&lt;/p></code> when you’re done. You open a <code class="nopad">&lt;h3></code> subhead and <code class="nopad">&lt;/h3></code> close it before moving on to another tag. In this way, the browser knows that one tag has closed before another begins. In <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, the closing of some tags is mandatory, while with other tags it’s optional. That inconsistency has led to sloppy markup, which in turn has caused browser problems, especially when other web standards (such as <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) begin to interact with your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. So it’s a good idea to close most <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags whether it’s strictly required or not. (In <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, the successor to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, all tags must be closed.)</p>
                <h2>Code Wars</h2>
                <p>As five minutes of web browsing will show you, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has been twisted every which way to enable web designers to create documents that are not so logical in their construction nor so restricted in their presentation. Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>) and JavaScript are additional technologies that enable designers and developers to create attractive, accessible, dynamic web documents.</p>
                <p>In theory, web designers should let <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> be <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, using it merely as a structured container for content, while relying on <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to format pages. In practice, web designers had to design pages long before <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> was invented, so most of us developed methods for using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> as a design tool. Even after <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> was invented (1996), the first reliably <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-capable browser did not hit the market until 2000. As of this writing, support for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is still tragically far from complete in many popular browsers. More about that—including solutions—in <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>, "Style Sheets for Designers."</p>
                <h3>Table Talk</h3>
                <p>As a result of the Thousand Year March toward <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> compliance and while waiting for better browsers, designers still use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> for tasks it performs reliably, if grudgingly, such as creating visual layouts by manipulating <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!-- Begin menu bar. --><br>
                        &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center"><br>
                        &lt;tr><br>
                        &lt;td><br>
                        &lt;a href="reading.html">&lt;img src="reading.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="Reading">&lt;/a><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;td><br>
                        &lt;a href="writing.html">&lt;img src="writing.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="Writing">&lt;/a><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;td><br>
                        &lt;a href="arithmetic.html">&lt;img src="arithmetic.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="Arithmetic">&lt;/a><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;/tr><br>
                        &lt;/table><br>
                        &lt;!-- End menu bar. -->
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>The previous code, in conjunction with the appropriate <code class="nopad">&lt;img></code> images (reading.gif, writing.gif, arithmetic.gif), will result in a clickable navigational menu in visual web browsers such as <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>, Netscape Navigator, Opera, and iCab. The table is used not to present tabular data (such as the contents of a spreadsheet) but rather to hold images in place. Setting the border to "0" disguises the tabular structure to facilitate pure visual purposes. Typing the width and height for each image helps the browser more quickly calculate how the data is supposed to lay out on the page. The <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> attribute in each image tag makes the content accessible to users of audio browsers and nontraditional browsers such as Palm Pilots, as well as for those who surf with images turned off.</p>		
                <h3><abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> Marks the Spot</h3>	
                <p>We keep emphasizing that <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is logical and orderly. Let us return for a moment to the question of closing tags after they are opened. This practice may seem redundant, but there is a logic to it. Refer again to the preceding example. Say that your paragraph is followed by an image. If you don’t close your paragraph <code class="nopad">&lt;/p></code> before starting the image <code class="nopad">&lt;IMG></code> tag, the browser has to guess whether you intend the image to be part of the paragraph or to follow it. Depending on what the browser guesses, your image might be preceded by a carriage return, or it might not be. If you’re using a style sheet that includes leading (<em>line-height</em> in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> parlance), the browser might attempt to impose that leading on your image—or it may not. These are merely the visual complications that can arise from something as simple as an unclosed tag. The structural ramifications can be more serious.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> recommends that you close most tags, but it does not force you to do so, and it does not uniformly recommend tag closure. Images <code class="nopad">&lt;IMG></code>, line breaks <code class="nopad">&lt;br></code>, and list items <code class="nopad">&lt;li></code>, for instance, are never closed in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Most older browsers will accept and attempt to display all kinds of shoddy markup, including markup with unclosed tags that should be closed. And some browsers choke on optionally unclosed tags when, according to the rules of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, they should simply process the markup without qualms. For instance, Netscape’s 4.0 browser refuses to display web pages with unclosed table rows, even though the rules of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4 state that table rows need not be closed.</p>
                <p>This inconsistency in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (and browsers) has resulted in sloppy markup on a surprising number of professional sites. Living in filth promotes diseases in human beings; slinging dirty markup can have equally dire effects on the health of the Web, particularly as the medium attempts to move forward.</p>
                <p>For this reason, among others, in 2000 the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> stopped evolving <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and came up with a new standard called <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>. Don’t sweat it. For a web designer’s purposes, <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> is essentially <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> that forces you to close your tags—including those (such as <code class="nopad">&lt;img></code>, <code class="nopad">&lt;br></code>, and <code class="nopad">&lt;li></code>) that never required such closure before.</p>
                <p>We don’t want to confuse you with yet another acronym, but the reason <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> works this way is because <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> only looks like <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. It is actually the offspring of <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, which is the standard toward which the Web is evolving. (Technically, <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> is a <em>meta-language</em>. That is, it is a set of rules for creating languages. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is a markup language based on the <em><abbr title="Standard Generalized Markup Language">SGML</abbr></em> meta-language. <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> is a reformulation of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> using <em><abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr></em> as the meta-language. You don’t really need to know this, but it’s great at parties, particularly when you’re trying to make someone stop talking to you.)</p>
                <h3>Minding Your &lt;p>’s and q’s</h3>
                <p>Instead of trying to grasp the mind-numbing sentences above, you can think of <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> as a much smarter—and necessarily more complex—adaptation of the idea behind <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; as Homo sapiens to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>’s Cro-Magnon, if you will; as a structured meta-language for containing data, if you must. In <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, you construct your own tags. Not only that, an <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> tag "knows" what other tags on the page are doing. An <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag does not. Neither does an <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> tag (at least, not yet). But <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> follows the rules of <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, chief among them the demand that all code be "well-formed." Tags that close after they open are demonstrating <em>well-formedness</em> in <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> parlance.</p>
                <p>Exploring <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> is beyond the scope of this book and is also beyond your immediate job requirements as a web designer. In all probability you will spend the next few years working with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>. In practical terms, working with <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> is just like working with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, except that it enforces cleaner coding practices. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> doesn’t care if you clean up your room. <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> does.</p>
                <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
                <p>What you need to understand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Web designers must learn <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, even if most of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> work at their jobs is performed by web technicians. Web designers who choose not to learn <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> will limit their creative thinking as well as their employability. Frankly, few good web firms would hire a designer who lacks at least basic knowledge of the technology that drives the medium, though many would hire a great designer whose initial <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> skills are merely adequate. Fortunately, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is very simple and thus very easy to learn.</span></li>
                    <li><span><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was not created as a design tool, and within the next year or two, we will no longer be using it as one. However...</span></li>
                    <li><span>...the Web is in transition, from an anything-goes "tag soup" to a more usable and logical division of labor between technologies that structure content (<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>, <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>) and companion technologies that format its display (mainly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>).</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you begin working at a web shop, you or your coworkers will likely be formatting your pages in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (or <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>) to make them compatible with late 1990s browsers. You will use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> as well, but initially only in limited ways (more about that in <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>). Soon, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> will do more and more of the design work, and <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and its successors will be used as the Web’s creators originally intended.</p>

                <div class="h6">
                    <p>On the Web, files are referenced by Uniform Resource Locators (<abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>) like this one:</p>
                    <p><a href="//web.archive.org/web/20001018141645/http://www.populi.com" title="Check out what populi.com looked like back in 2000.">http://www.populi.com/index.html</a></p>
                    <p>These <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> are to cyberspace what street addresses are to the real world—no two addresses are exactly the same.</p>
                    <p>UNIX was used to serve most sites at the dawning of the Web, and consequently, <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> follow the conventions of the UNIX Operating System (for instance, <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> are case-sensitive because UNIX is case-sensitive). UNIX is still used to serve heaps of sites due to its stability and its deep roots in the history of the Internet.</p>
                    <p>Other popular web-serving operating systems include Windows NT and, increasingly, Linux. Linux is a free, open-source version of UNIX. Macs also can serve websites, though most companies prefer to host on UNIX or NT because these platforms were designed for the job. That may change somewhat now that Apple has unveiled Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>X—its next-generation operating system with UNIX underpinnings.</p>
                    <p>In UNIX, slashes separate directory names from each other and from document names, and all web servers follow these conventions.</p>
                    <p>The names of web documents (including images, movies, and audio files) generally end in a three- or four-character abbreviation that clues the web server (and the browser) as to what they are (and thus, how they should be handled). <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents end in .html (or sometimes .htm); <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> images end in .jpg (portrait.jpg); Flash files end in .swf (grandioseintro.swf); and so on.</p>
                    <p>All web-serving platforms follow these conventions in naming. Windows 3.1 is limited to three-letter abbreviations, so .htm is used on that platform. Few sites are served from Windows 3.1, however, and you are astronomically unlikely to encounter Windows 3.1 servers in your professional career—at least in the United States, Canada, and Europe.</p>
                    <p>Apache is a powerful web-serving platform with many conventions that designers follow even if they don’t know why they’re doing so. For instance, at the root level (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20001018141645/http://www.populi.com" title="Check out what populi.com looked like back in 2000.">www.populi.com</a>), if you include a document titled index.html, that document will open automatically when the visitor types <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20001018141645/http://www.populi.com" title="Check out what populi.com looked like back in 2000.">www.populi.com</a>. This is why the ads can say "Visit www.spamulator.com" instead of "Visit www.spamulator.com/index.html." This is also why, in writing code, you can save bandwidth with <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> references such as:</p>
                    <p><code>&lt;a href="http://www.nostril.com/"></code></p>
                    <p>Instead of:</p>
                    <p><code>&lt;a href="http://www.nostril.com/index.html"></code></p>
                    <p>It’s also why you can reference internal files in this way:</p>
                    <p>Visit the <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="contact/">CONTACT&lt;/a></code> page.</p>
                    <p>Instead of:</p>
                    <p>Visit the <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="contact/index.html">CONTACT&lt;/a></code> page.</p>
                    <p>Or:</p>
                    <p>Visit the <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="http://www.nostril.com/contact/index.html">CONTACT&lt;/a></code> page.</p>
                    <p>The systems administrator can override this default if she desires, allowing welcome.html (for instance) to serve as the default opening document. In fact, welcome.html was the default opening document on many systems before index.html gained ascendancy. The default page at www.zeldman.com is still welcome.html. (The old CERN server used Welcome.htm, complete with initial caps.)</p>
                    <p>These conventions vary by system. Internet Information Server (IIS), on Windows, uses default.html or default.asp. Again, the systems administrator is free to override any such default. (Pickledherring.html could be set up as the default document if desired.) If your server or systems administrator prefers a particular filename, you’ll be told about it on the job.</p>
                </div>
                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                <p>There are plenty of books about <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, and heaps of free online resources. After all, what better place than the Web itself to learn about the markup language with which the Web is created?</p>
                <p>The beginner’s tutorials at Project Cool’s Gettingstarted.net (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102021519/http://www.gettingstarted.net" title="Check out what gettingstarted.net looked like back in 2001.">www.gettingstarted.net</a>) and Jay Boersma’s Web Work (<a href="" title="Unfortunately this link is dead. :-(">www.ECNet.Net/users/gallery/webwork/www.html</a>) can teach anyone, even your Uncle Phil, how to apply basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags to create simple web pages. A more detailed tutorial, Ian S. Graham’s "Introduction to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>," may be found at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102021400/http://www.utoronto.ca/webdocs/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/htmlindex.html" title="Check out what utoronto.ca/webdocs/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/htmlindex.html looked like back in 2001.">www.utoronto.ca/webdocs/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/htmlindex.html</a>, and our own "Ask Doctor Web" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101191748/http://www.zeldman.com/askdrweb" title="Check out what zeldman.com/askdrweb/ looked like back in 2001.">www.zeldman.com/askdrweb/</a>), online since 1995, provides a readable overview on <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and related technologies along with the psychology of web use and similar topics. After you’re further along, you are sure to enjoy Lance Arthur’s Design-o-Rama at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101232143/http://glassdog.com/design-o-rama" title="Check out what glassdog.com/design-o-rama/ looked like back in 2001.">www.glassdog.com/design-o-rama/</a>, a wittily written treatise that includes a good introduction to frames and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>These are but five of many such resources online. Most of these resources are noncommercial in nature. They exist only to share knowledge. We told you the Web was different, didn’t we? (On the Web, this would be a hyperlink back to <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, "Designing for the Medium.")</p>
                <p>Being noncommercial, such resources might not always be completely up-to-date. For instance, parts of Ask Dr Web show their age visually, and in places, the advice offered might not be up to current standards. Nevertheless, they are all excellent places for those who don’t know their <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> from their elbow to begin absorbing vital knowledge. We urge you to visit them all before moving on to the following more advanced resources.</p>
                <p>For a superb, hand-holding tutorial that walks you through the entire realm of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, you can’t beat <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> member Dave Raggett’s "Getting Started With <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240640/http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide" title="Check out what w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/ looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/</a>). It’s simple and complete; it touches on <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, JavaScript, and Image maps as well as <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; and it comes from a definitive source. (Raggett has been closely involved with the development of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> since the Web’s earliest days.)</p>
                <p>The Web Design Group’s "Web Authoring <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr>" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101290748/http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/all.html" title="Check out what htmlhelp.com/faq/html/all.html looked like back in 2001.">www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/all.html</a>) is yet another fine source of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> knowledge. It even answers questions such as "How can I get my own domain name?" "Where can I announce my site?" and the ever-popular "How can I make a frame with a vertical scrollbar but without a horizontal scrollbar?"</p>
                <p>After you’ve gotten a handle on these basics, you’ll be able to learn from the fine tutorials and articles at Webmonkey (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240036/http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey" title="Check out what hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/ looked like back in 2001.">hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/</a>), Builder.com (<a href="//www.cnet.com/1990-7381_1-6222935-1.html" title="Check out home.cnet.com/webbuilding/.">home.cnet.com/webbuilding/</a>), and our own A List Apart (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182141/http://www.alistapart.com" title="Check out what alistapart.com looked like back in 2001.">www.alistapart.com</a>). Along with technical exercises and techniques, these three resources offer a bevy of useful tips, tricks, opinions, and (best of all) insights into the changing nature of web code, design, and content.</p>
                <p>You’ll be able also to visit the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>’s "<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>L 4.01 Specification" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010407031721/http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40" title="Check out what w3.org/TR/REC-html40/ looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/</a>) without experiencing heart palpitations. This spec is the Mothership, though it can leave a neophyte feeling somewhat shaky. Also worth getting to know is "The Bare Bones Guide to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101092351/http://www.werbach.com/barebones" title="Check out what werbach.com/barebones/ looked like back in 2001.">www.werbach.com/barebones/</a>) and Ron Woodall’s <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Compendium (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012180549/http://htmlcompendium.org/Menu/0framefn.htm" title="Check out what htmlcompendium.org looked like back in 2000.">www.htmlcompendium.org</a>). These three resources provide a head-to-toe anatomy of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> language. Forget an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag? Not sure how one is supposed to work? Consult these guides.</p>
                <p>But don’t start with them. You’ll just upset yourself. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is simple, but viewing dozens of pages of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags and their scientific-sounding definitions can daunt the staunchest heart. Begin at the beginner’s sites, which are written in civilian-friendly language. And learn to do one other essential thing:</p>
                <h2>View Source</h2>
                <p>Most of us learned <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, not from each other’s tutorials, but by studying the markup with which others’ web pages were built. Imitation is the sincerest form of theft, and every one of us started out by copying and pasting other people’s markup, changing it around, and seeing what happened. Before we discuss the ethics, here’s how to get started:</p>
                <p>When you find a web page you like, select <strong>View, Source</strong> from your browser’s menu bar, and save the file to your hard drive. (In Netscape, choose <strong>View, Page Source</strong>.) Reopen it in a basic text editor (such as Simple Text or Write) or an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor (such as Barebones Software’s BBEdit, Optima Software’s PageSpinner, or Allaire’s HomeSite) and stare at the code until it stares back. Plug your own words in between the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags, save your work, and open the file in your favorite web browser. Result: your first (offline) web page.</p>
                <p>Unless the layout you’ve stolen is extremely basic, you should keep it offline. You don’t want to upload what you steal. You just want to learn and move on. Here are the links for the editors mentioned PREVIOUS:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span><strong>Bare Bones Software BBEdit.</strong> <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010331030805/http://www.bbedit.com" title="Check out what bbedit.com looked like back in 2001.">www.bbedit.com</a> (for Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>)</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Optima-System Page Spinner.</strong> <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240712/http://www.optima-system.com/pagespinner" title="Check out what optima-system.com/pagespinner/ looked like back in 2001.">www.optima-system.com/pagespinner/</a> (for Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>)</span></li>
                    <li><span><strong>Allaire HomeSite.</strong> <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101040415/http://www.allaire.com/products/Homesite" title="Check out what allaire.com/products/homesite/ looked like back in 2001.">www.allaire.com/products/homesite/</a> (for Windows)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <h3>A Netscape Bonus</h3>
                <p>In addition to View Source, Netscape Navigator’s browser includes a nifty File menu option called <strong>View Page Info</strong>. Choose it, and the entire page will be deconstructed for you in a new window, image by image. Beside each image’s name you’ll find its complete <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> (you remember...its address on the Web), its file size, how many colors it contains, and whether or not it uses transparency. Click the link beside each image, and the image will load in the bottom of the window.</p>
                <p>The way this works is not immediately intuitive; it was laid out by engineers, not by designers or usability experts. But once you get the hang of it, you’ll find View Page Info a useful tool for understanding how other people have created web pages. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> does not offer this feature.</p>
                <h3>The Mother of All View Source Tricks</h3>
                <p>Viewing source is all well and good, but what’s even better is viewing that source code in your text editor of choice. That way, you can continue to work in your chosen <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editing environment instead of dragging and dropping (or cutting and pasting) between different software programs. You also will have less clutter on your screen. And if your editing program wraps text, you won’t have to cope with the endless lines of markup that browsers often spit out by default in their built-in View Source windows.</p>
                <h4>Doin’ it in Netscape</h4>
                <p><span class="orange">On the Mac:</span> Pay a visit to your Netscape Options menu. Under <strong>Options, Applications, View Source</strong>, switch from the default program to your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editing program of choice (for instance, BBEdit or PageSpinner). Now when you view the source of any of your existing web pages, the resulting <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document will automatically open in your preferred <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> program, ready for further editing. Pretty nifty. Similarly, when you View Source on someone else’s site, the code will open in your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor of choice, tempting you to steal other people’s work and condemn your soul to Hell.</p>
                <p><span class="orange">In Windows:</span> First of all, you need to install the entire Communicator program, not just the Navigator component. From Composer (the extremely limited semi-<abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> "page creation" tool bundled with Netscape’s browser), choose Edit then Preferences. Click Composer and register your external editor for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Source. There. That really wasn’t so bad.</p>
                <h4>Doin’ it in Internet Explorer</h4>
                <p>First, open Explorer’s Preferences. Go to File Helpers and click Add.</p>
                <p>In a new, blank dialog box, type <strong>Source Code</strong> under Description, .html under Extension, and source/html under <abbr title="Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions">MIME</abbr> type.</p>
                <p>In the File Type area, click Browse. It sounds as if you’re about to browse the Web, but you’re not. You are actually navigating your hard drive to locate your web editor of choice. Select it, and the File type and File creator areas will be filled in automatically.</p>
                <p>You’re not done yet. Under Handling, choose Post-Process With Application. Hit the second Browse button, select your web editor one more time, and then hit OK. Then stand on your head and recite the Cub Scout pledge. Just kidding about the pledge thing.</p>
                <p>Now when you View Source, the code will open in your favorite web editor. Not push-button easy, but it works—and you only have to do this once.</p>
                <p>We figure these tips alone justify the cost of buying this book, and we expect you to dog-ear this page and fondle it quietly when you think no one is watching.</p>
                <h2>Absolutely Speaking, It's All Relative</h2>
                <p><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> links can work several ways. The simplest link (and often the easiest to maintain) is the relative link.</p>
                <p>Two files reside in the same directory:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">index.html<br>
                    thankyou.html</span></p>
                <p>A relative link from <span class="orange">index.html</span> to <span class="orange">thankyou.html</span> looks like this:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">There is a special message for you on our <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="thankyou.html">Thank You&lt;/a></code> page.</span></p>
                <p>By contrast, an absolute link might look like this:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">There is a special message for you on our <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="http://www.ourcompany.com/thankyou.html">Thank You&lt;/a></code> page.</span></p>
                <p>Or even this:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">There is a special message for you on our <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="http://www.ourcompany.com/customerrelations/special/thankyou.html">Thank You&lt;/a></code> page.</span></p>
                <p>These are called <code class="nopad">&lt;ABSOLUTE></code> links because they refer to an absolute, concrete location in web space. (Well, as real or concrete as "web space" gets, anyway.)</p>
                <p>When two pages reside in the same directory, there is no need to use absolute links. Using relative links lowers your character count (you can get rid of <span class="orange">http://www.ourcompany.com/customerrelations/special/</span>), and that, in turn, conserves bandwidth.</p>
                <p>Relative links are easy to maintain on simple sites (though they become fiendishly complex as a site grows and uses more and more directories). For instance, if all images are kept in a directory called Images, the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to an image file might read like so:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;IMG SRC="images/image.gif"></code></p>
                <p>We have left out the image’s height, width, and <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> attribute to simplify the presentation of this idea. However, as previously mentioned, it is always important to include an image’s height and width to help some browsers display the layout more quickly. And, as also previously mentioned, it is essential to include <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> attributes so that those with visual disabilities or those who surf with images turned off will have some idea of the image’s function.</p>
                <p>The more complicated the site’s directory structure, the likelier relative links are to require debugging. For instance, the reader is here:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">somesite.com/julyissue/index.html</span></p>
                <p>And you wish to direct her back to the index page at:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">somesite.com/index.html</span></p>
                <p>The <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> would read as follows:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;a href="../index.html">Back&lt;/a> to the Index Page.</code></p>
                <p>The two dots (..) preceding the slash mean "go up one directory level before locating this file."</p>
                <p>With more directories, you have more and more complex links:</p>
                <p><code class="nopad">&lt;a href="../../../../../index.html">Back&lt;/a></code> to the Index Page.</p>
                <p>This can quickly lead to madness. Are you stuck writing out full, absolute <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>? Heck, no.</p>
                <p>Instead, you can use a shorthand form of absolute linking to retain the advantages of relative <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> (portability, low bandwidth) while maintaining the clarity of absolute <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>.</p>
                <p>Absolute <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> also can be written like so:</p>
                <p><span class="orange">/index.html</span></p>
                <p>Where the slash represents "root directory."</p>
                <p>By using this method, if you wished to move from the July Issue index page up one directory to the root level index page, your <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> would look like this:</p>
                <p>Return to the <code>&lt;a href="/index.html">front page&lt;/a></code>.</p>
                <p>Or like this (which is even smaller and doesn’t hardcode the default directory index filename):</p>
                <p>Return to the <code>&lt;a href="/">front page&lt;/a></code>.</p>
                <p>And reversing the direction, a link from /index.html to /julyissue/index.html would look like this:</p>
                <p>Read the <code>&lt;a href="/julyissue/">July issue&lt;/a></code>.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, absolute <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> of this kind cannot be tested offline. You must load these pages to your web server to make certain the links work correctly.</p>
                <p>By contrast, relative links work on or offline, which enables you to keep one or more fully functioning web sites on your hard drive.</p>
                <p>That was relatively painless, wasn’t it? Absolutely.</p>
                <h2>What Is Good Markup?</h2>
                <p>Technically, good <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is code that validates—that is, code that fully complies with current <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards and contains no errors. To make sure your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> validates, run it through the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> validator at validator.w3.org, a free service from those wonderful people who brought you the Web. For more on this topic, see "<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> Standards Compliance: Why Bother?" in the Web Developer’s Virtual Library (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20000815194812/http://wdvl.com/Authoring/HTML/Standards" title="Check out what WDVL.com/Authoring/HTML/Standards/ looked like back in 2000.">WDVL.com/Authoring/HTML/Standards/</a>).</p>
                <p>For the validator to work properly, you need to include a <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPE></code>. This is a simple declaration that specifies what kind of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (or other markup language) you are attempting to write. For instance:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"></code></p>
                <p>This declares the document to be <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 strict. <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 strict emphasizes structure over presentation and balks at "deprecated elements" such as background colors in table cells, <code class="nopad">&lt;FONT FACE></code>, <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMES></code>, and other stuff we’re supposed to do with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> instead of in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.</p>
                <p>Newer browsers such as <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac, Netscape 6, and Mozilla render <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 strict documents according to web standards and use a "quirks" mode for older or unspecified document types to emulate rendering bugs in older browsers. The engineers responsible for these browsers applied these techniques to offer full standards support for new sites without breaking old sites that were written to the quirks of the companies’ older, nonstandards-oriented browsers. Those older browsers generally ignore the <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPE></code> declaration completely, but the validator requires it.</p>
                <p><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"></code></p>
                <p>This <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPE></code> declares that the web page is written in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 transitional markup, which tolerates deprecated presentational <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> attributes (<code class="nopad">&lt;FONT FACE></code>, for example) so that such documents will render correctly in older, less standards-compliant browsers. <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>5/Mac, Netscape 6, Mozilla and <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> 6 will render these documents the same way older browsers would. This affords web designers the ability to support older and newer browsers while making the transition from a buggy Web to one that relies on standards. (See the section, "The 18-Month Pregnancy" in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a> to understand why a transitional or interim period is accommodated in this way.)</p>
                <p>Other <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPE></code>s include <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 3.2, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4.01 Frameset, and <abbr title="eXtensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> Strict and Transitional.</p>
                <h3>What Is Sensible Markup?</h3>
                <p>Conceptually, good markup is code that gets out of its own way and helps communicate your message in the simplest, most intuitive way possible—just like good design.</p>
                <p>Beginning writers use too many adjectives. Beginning designers use too many shapes, fonts, and colors. Beginning <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> authors often fall so in love with the medium that they forget to communicate. Instead, they cram every page with embedded <abbr title="Musical Instrument Digital Interface">MIDI</abbr> (music) files, pointlessly scrolling JavaScript messages, huge full-color photographs, animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s (flames and dripping blood are especially popular), and blinking and moving text, often in a dozen different font faces and sizes.</p>
                <p>That is bad design, and (we think) bad markup, even if it validates—which is pretty unlikely because folks attracted to dripping blood animations tend not to spend much time learning about web standards.</p>

                        <p>This site for the Web Standards Project contains almost no graphics. The shapes and colors are created using nothing more than <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. It is possible to fill the screen with color and content without wasting bandwidth on images. As a bonus, the code validates (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050037/http://webstandards.org" title="Check out what webstandards.org looked like back in 2001.">www.webstandards.org</a>).</p>

                <h2 class="clearfix"><abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> as a Design Tool</h2>
                <p>Though this won’t always be the case, one of the beautiful things about <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (and eventually, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> instead) is that it can be used as a powerful design tool—a design tool that loads instantly. No images are required; there are no fancy plug-ins and no worries about every user having the latest browser.</p>
                <p>Consider the front page of The Web Standards Project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050037/http://webstandards.org" title="Check out what webstandards.org looked like back in 2001.">www.webstandards.org</a>). Aside from one large Seymour-Chwast-like illustration, the rest of the front page is designed entirely with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Now view the source.</p>
                <p>An <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> color in the <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> tag defines the entire background. The content grid is made up of a table, and the grid areas and background colors are defined with table cell colors.</p>
                <p>The content area is enclosed within a black outline created with one line of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>. Originally, the same effect was created by wrapping one <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> table inside another.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> is used to create the typography and leading.</p>
                <p>Creating a layout like this in Photoshop, cutting its elements into pieces, and assembling those pieces via <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, would have resulted in a large web page composed of many small files that would take a long time to download. (And if the visitor had images turned off, the visual effect would be lost.)</p>
                <p>Creating the layout in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> means that the page loads almost instantly, no matter how slow the visitor’s connection may be. And the layout is backward compatible with browsers dating back to Netscape 3 (a 1997 browser), although the <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> formatting will be lost in that browser. Actually, the site is viewable in any browser. Older browsers will lose the design branding effects, but the content will still be readily accessible.</p>
                <p>Note that this is a transitional web design strategy. It respects bandwidth by using web technology (instead of image files) to create visual and branding effects—but at the cost of relying on deprecated presentational <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> attributes. Most of these effects can be generated in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> alone, with <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> serving simply as the structural container of content. This is what the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> recommends, and this is the way we will build all sites in the near future and forever after.

                <p>However, as we mentioned in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, old browsers that do a poor job at understanding <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> are still widely used in the market we serve. And as you’ll see in <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>, browsers that stumble over <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> don’t simply render it incorrectly. They can actually crash and burn. For this reason, as you begin your career in web design, you will undoubtedly be using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables and other deprecated presentational <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> attributes to control your web layouts and visual effects. Thus there is value in learning how to do this in ways that minimize wasted bandwidth and comply with the letter (though not the spirit) of <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards. The lessons you learn in building sites this way will apply equally well when you are free to control your site designs exclusively with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>

                <h2 class="clearfix">Plug-ins and Tables and Frames, Oh My!</h2>
                <p>In the transitional Web, designers use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables to lay out pages, as just described (with additional commentary and how-to-do-it type verbiage to come in the next chapter). We also use <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMES></code>, a Netscape "extension" to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> which has temporarily made it into the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4 Transitional standard but which will eventually go the way of the Dodo bird.</p>
                <p>Frames are nothing more than pages within pages, for example:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;FRAMESET COLS="80,2,*" frameborder="no" border="0" framespacing="0"><br>
                        &lt;FRAME SRC="nav.html" NAME="nav" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" noresize scrolling="auto"><br>
                        &lt;FRAME SRC="black.html" NAME="black" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" noresize scrolling="no"><br>
                        &lt;FRAME SCROLLING=auto SRC="content.html" NAME="content" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"><br>
                        &lt;/FRAMESET>
                    </code>	
                </p>	
                <p>In this markup, <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMESET></code> tells the browser that the page contains frames. <code class="nopad">&lt;COLS></code> (short for columns) specifies that the frameset contains three columns. The first is 80 pixels wide; the second is 2 pixels wide; and the last fills the remaining width of the browser window.</p>
                <p>We also can tell the browser whether or not we want borders on our frames; whether or not each frame should permit the viewer to scroll content; whether or not each frame is user-resizable; and what size margin we’d like on each frame. Because we’re designers, we turn margins off entirely (<span class="orange">marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"</span>) and use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> or tables to control the margins on each individual frame—each frame, of course, being nothing more than an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document (<span class="orange">nav.html</span>, <span class="orange">black.html</span>, <span class="orange">content.html</span>).</p>
                <p>We also name each frame for targeting purposes. After all, when visitors click in a menu area, we want the content they’ve chosen to show up in the content frame—not in the menu frame. Assigning a target name to each frame enables us to write links like <code class="nopad">&lt;a href="companypolicy.html" target ="content"></code>. Naming also enables us to perform JavaScript stunts, which are mainly useful for avoiding the maddening usability hazards associated with frames, such as the following.</p>
                <h3>The Frames of Hazard</h3>
                <p>Through a search engine such as <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182144/http://www.google.com" title="Check out what Google.com looked like back in 2001.">Google.com</a>, Aunt Moira finds one of our client’s content pages. Unfortunately, that’s all she finds—the naked content page, immodestly lacking its associated navigational menu frame. Aunt Moira has no idea where she is, where she can go next, who created the site, or even how to find its home page.</p>
                <p>We always had it in for Aunt Moira, who never failed to point out when we had gained weight or burst out in pimples, but our client would like her to be able to use the site. Because we have named our frames and because the good Lord (well, actually, Netscape) gave us JavaScript, we can instruct the browser to load named frames if they are not already visible on the page.</p>
                <p>Thus when Aunt Moira (the old biddy) blunders her way into <span class="orange">companypolicy.html</span>, the browser is instructed to load the missing frames. Code like this would appear on each <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document that made up the frame, though not on the frameset document itself:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!-- This one makes sure the left nav is loaded. --><br>
                        &lt;script LANGUAGE="JavaScript"><br>
                        <span class="extraleft">&lt;!--</span><br>
                        <span class="extraleft">if (top == self) self.location.href = "frameset.html";</span><br>
                        <span class="doubleextraleft">// --></span><br> 
                        &lt;/script>	
                    </code>		
                </p>
                <p>Such a script tells the browser to make sure that <span class="orange">frameset.html</span> has loaded. If it has not loaded—if Aunt Moira’s browser is about to show a confusing single frame no more illuminating than a single puzzle piece—the browser gathers and assembles the missing pieces before the dear old thing has a chance to notice that anything is amiss. We don’t want to get ahead of ourselves by discussing JavaScript in the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> chapter. Suffice to say, the need to rely on such scripts points out <em>some</em> of the hazards of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMES></code>, and helps explain why they are on their way out.</p>
                <p>Everything we now do with frames (and more) we can do with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, which is standards-compliant and avoids the usability and accessibility hazards <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMES></code> engender. But to switch from <code class="nopad">&lt;FRAMES></code> to <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, we must wait for some browsers to improve their <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> support and all users to upgrade to these better browsers.</p>
                <h3>Please Frame Safely</h3>
                <p>Some old browsers do not understand frames. Neither do text and audio browsers. Nor do Palm Pilots and web-enabled telephones. To accommodate these devices and browsers, your frameset should include a <code class="nopad">&lt;NOFRAMES></code> tag. Browsers that can’t read frames can read the plain <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> that you insert between opening <code class="nopad">&lt;NOFRAMES></code> and closing <code class="nopad">&lt;/NOFRAMES></code> tags. Copy the content that appears in your frames, paste it between the <code class="nopad">&lt;NOFRAMES></code> tags, and you are on your way to creating a site everyone can access, regardless of their browser’s capabilities.</p>
                <h3>Framing Your Art</h3>
                <p>Despite these hazards and hassles, frames can be quite useful to web designers. Frames allow you to present a menu bar that stays in place while content frames change. They also enable you to create layouts where, for instance, your content will always appear in the center of the screen, regardless of the visitor’s monitor size. View Marc Klein’s Creative Republic (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010401110732/http://www.creative-republic.com" title="Check out what creative-republic.com looked like back in 2001.">www.creative-republic.com</a>) to see this in action, and then view the source to see how Marc crafted his framesets.</p>
                <p>One other maddening thing about frames is that though Netscape invented them, it never got them exactly right. When you tell the browser to make your menu bar 25 pixels tall, you may get 25 pixels in Netscape 4, but you’re just as likely to get 32 or 16. If this suggests that you’re better off avoiding frames whenever possible, we won’t argue.</p>
                <p>In addition to tables and frames, web designers use applets and multimedia files to create designs that are frankly unimaginable in print. We will discuss those in <a href="12.html" title="Check out chapter 12.">Chapter 12</a>, "Beyond Text/Pictures." Don’t skip ahead, we’re watching.</p>

                <h2 class="clearfix">&lt;META> &lt;META> Hiney Ho!</h2>
                <p>Though <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags have many purposes, web designers and developers most often use them for one of two reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Accommodating search engines</span></li>
                    <li><span>Reloading pages or forwarding visitors to an updated page</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Regardless of the application, <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags are placed in the <code class="nopad">&lt;HEAD></code> section of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup. That is, all <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> elements show up between the <code class="nopad">&lt;HEAD></code> and the <code class="nopad">&lt;/HEAD></code> tags. Now let’s wrap our own <code class="nopad">&lt;HEADS></code> around them to see how this all works:</p>
                <h3>Search Me</h3>
                <p>When Aunt Moira (the old battleaxe) enlists the help of a search engine to find a topic or subject, one way in which the search engine might sort data is through <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags. Some search engines compare search words with <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> descriptions, and they return the web pages that provide the best matches, as in the following:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;META NAME= "author" CONTENT= "your name"><br>
                        &lt;META NAME= "description" CONTENT= "page description"><br>
                        &lt;META NAME= "keywords" CONTENT= "keywords that apply to your page"><br>
                        &lt;META NAME= "generator" CONTENT= "the editor you used to create your page"><br> 
                        &lt;META NAME= "copyright" CONTENT= "date of copyright"><br>
                        &lt;META NAME= "expires" CONTENT= "expiration date">
                    </code>
                </p>			
                <p>Most corporate and business-to-business sites will include only the <code class="nopad">&lt;DESCRIPTION></code>, <code class="nopad">&lt;KEYWORD></code>, and <code class="nopad">&lt;COPYRIGHT></code> tags. After all, AT&amp;T does not need its customers to know who designed the site, what tool they used to edit the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or how old (and outdated) the page may be.</p>
                <p>Aside from <code class="nopad">&lt;HTTP-EQUIV></code> (the widely accepted predecessor to <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPE></code>), there is no reliable standard for <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code>. Most search engines rarely use them (Google, for instance, ignores them). Those such as Altavista and Hotbot, which once relied on them extensively, pay them less and less heed as time goes by. Good <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> tags and good, descriptive page copy are more effective at scoring with search engines and directories.</p>
                <p>In spite of everything we’ve said, some search engines and directories do pay attention to these tags, and it sometimes falls to the designer to write them. So let’s look at some good and bad ones. Here is a good one:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "description" CONTENT= "Widgets.com builds reliable widgets for the lubrication industry. As the American Midwest’s largest developer and supplier of industrial-strength widgetry, we offer a product line of 2,000 parts as well as custom products built to your specifications. Standard products ship in 48 hours in the Continental <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>, and within three business days to lubricant concerns in Europe, Asia, and Africa."></code></p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "keywords" CONTENT= "widgets, lubricants, lubrication, industry, <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr>, mid-west, developer, supplier, industrial strength, widgetry, 2,000, standard, parts, custom, product, development, shipping, 48 hours, Canada, Europe, Asia, Africa"></code></p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "copyright" CONTENT= "12 January 2001"></code></p>
                <p>And here is a bad use of <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "description" CONTENT= "Welcome to our home page on the World Wide Web! We are happy to serve you. Please do not hesitate to call on our reliable staff if we may serve you better in any way, shape, or form. This site is under construction. Some links may not work and some pages that we are going to make later have not shown up yet because we are still arguing about them in the boardroom. All our products are proudly made in the good old <abbr title="United States">U.S.</abbr> of A. We are a good company that has serious social concerns. Kids, stay in school. Hugs, not drugs. Have a nice day."></code></p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "keywords" CONTENT= "welcome, to, our, home, page, which, is, under, construction, serving, you, proudly, since, 1955, but, not, the, website, which, as, we, mentioned, is, under, construction"></code></p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "author" CONTENT= "your name here"></code></p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "author" CONTENT= "your name here"></code></p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "generator" CONTENT= "Hot Dog Pro"></code></p>
                <p>The good <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags help search engines hone in on what the site actually has to offer. The bad <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags consign the site to the dung heap, where it will never be found by any living soul—unless they are searching for <span class="orange">serve + kids + drugs</span>.</p>
                <p>Raw-elbowed marketing idiots, who are legion on the Internet, used to try to "upgrade" their search engine rankings by repeating certain keywords—a practice referred to as <em>keyword spamming</em>.</p>
                <p><code>&lt;META NAME= "keywords" CONTENT= "widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets, widgets"></code></p>
                <p>Needless to say, this no longer works, and if anything, you and the widgets you rode in on will be dropped to the very bottom of any halfway relevant search—or kicked out of the database altogether. Kids, don’t try this at home (page).</p>
                <p>As we say, most search engines ignore <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags, so if you want your site to be found, focus on developing relevant body text and <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> tags. "Welcome to our home page on the World Wide Web" is not relevant text. "Widgets.com builds reliable widgets for the lubrication industry" is relevant, if unsavory, text. <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> tags and body text are weighted more heavily than <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags, even by search engines that consider all three (<code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags, <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> tags, and body text). This is because it is easy for liars to lard their <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags with exciting buzzwords that have little to do with what the site actually offers. <em>Body text</em>—text seen by visitors—is therefore given precedence over the wishful thinking that goes on inside the <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tag.</p>
                <p>Everything we’ve just told you is probably outdated and irrelevant by now.

                <p>At a bad shop, <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags (and indeed, sometimes, body text) will be written at the last minute by a recent college graduate with no experience in marketing, communications, or the Web. When shopping for a job, don’t simply judge the company by its graphic design. Peek under the hood for evidence of a caring, intelligent environment—or a sweatshop that bangs work out with little regard for its success or failure in the marketplace.</p>
                <p>Wow, we’ve just saved you from taking a really bad job. This book is turning out to be worth every penny you paid for it, isn’t it? You ought to buy copies for all your friends, and save them from taking bad jobs, too.</p>
                <p>Another type of <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tag (the <code class="nopad">&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV></code>) does another type of job and is worth mentioning.</p>
                <h3>Take a (Re)Load Off</h3>
                <p>There are times where you want a page to hesitate and then reload. Though this may sound like a tricky process, <code class="nopad">&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV></code> tags make it barnyard-simple:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV= "REFRESH" CONTENT= "x; URL=http://www.widgets.com/"></code></p>
                <p>In this code example, <code class="nopad">&lt;x></code> represents the number of seconds before the refresh or reload occurs, and the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> refers to the page currently being viewed. (Obviously, you would replace <code class="nopad">&lt;x></code> with <code class="nopad">&lt;10></code>, <code class="nopad">&lt;6></code>, or however many seconds you wish to have elapse before the page reloads itself. There is no limit, to our knowledge, on how many seconds that may be. The browser tells time via the operating system. Uncanny, is it not?) Given that the visitor is already at <span class="orange">www.widgets.com</span>, why spell out the full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> instead of a relative <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> (such as <span class="orange">index.html</span>)? Trust us on this one. (If you don’t trust us, using a relative <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> will usually work, but can be problematic if the page you’re refreshing gets moved or renamed, which web pages often do. Full <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> make for better, safer maintenance in this instance.)</p>
                <p>You also can use this technique to forward the visitor from an old, outdated page to a shiny new one:</p>
                <p><code>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV= "REFRESH" CONTENT= "x; URL=http://www.widgets.com/newindex.html"></code></p>
                <p>Many <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> experts, being spoilsports who live in Ivory Towers and probably never laugh even at really funny jokes like the one about the traveling salesman, the farmer, the hippie, and the bus driver, disapprove of this entire procedure. They recommend that you forward web users to new pages (if need be) by using JavaScript. However, this <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tag technique does work, even with old, non-JavaScript-capable browsers.</p>
                <h2>A Comment About &lt;COMMENTS></h2>
                <p>In your career as a web designer, you will sometimes create entire sites by yourself from scratch. Most of the time, though, you will be working with a team. Occasionally, you will inherit an existing site that needs to be redesigned or updated. At other times, you will be creating a site for someone else to update. All these situations are best served if you <em>comment the code</em> as you write it. Referring once again to the code used earlier in this chapter:</p>
                <p>
                    <code>
                        &lt;!-- Begin menu bar. --><br>
                        &lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="center"><br>
                        &lt;tr><br>
                        &lt;td><br>
                        &lt;a href="reading.html">&lt;img src="reading.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="Reading">&lt;/a><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;td><br>
                        &lt;a href="writing.html">&lt;img src="writing.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="Writing">&lt;/a><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;td><br>
                        &lt;a href="arithmetic.html">&lt;img src="arithmetic.gif" width="20" height="20" border="0" alt="Arithmetic">&lt;/a><br>
                        &lt;/td><br>
                        &lt;/tr><br>
                        &lt;/table><br>
                        &lt;!-- End menu bar. -->
                    </code>	
                </p>		
                <p><code class="nopad">&lt;Begin menu bar></code> and <code class="nopad">&lt;End menu bar></code> are the comments that help you (or a teammate or successor) figure out what was intended by all that wacky <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. They are always enclosed within <code class="nopad">&lt;!-- special brackets --&gt;</code> so that they will not be displayed on the web page. Even if you routinely work alone (say, as a freelancer), comments will help you find your way when you return to an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document you haven’t looked at for six months. Professional web designers always comment their markup.</p>
                <p>In <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a> we mentioned that designers could save bandwidth by removing white space from their <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents. We also mentioned that most of us refrain from this practice because it interferes with the need to continually update existing web documents. Comments exist to facilitate that need. No further comment.</p>
                <h2><abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>, My Aunt Moira's Left Foot</h2>
                <p>We’ve all seen the ads: "Create web pages without learning a single <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tag!" We’ve also seen ads that tell us how to lose weight while eating candy bars all day long. Strangely enough, we know no one who’s lost weight that way.</p>
                <p>Today’s "What You See Is What You Get"( <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr>) programs are far more powerful than the early, lame-o programs that gave <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> a bad name. But most professional web designers continue to use text-based web editors. Why? In a word, control. In four words, to avoid bad markup.</p>
                <h3>Code of Dishonor</h3>
                <p>Though we hope to see this change soon, nearly all <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors tend to write bloated (and often invalid) <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup. To make sure that every browser—even one that’s five years old—will be able to display your page as the program thinks you want it to be seen, these programs will grind out all kinds of unnecessary workaround markup, adding unsightly flab to every web page.</p>
                <p>Other programs, notably one famous one we won’t mention for fear of lawsuits, tend to generate markup that works only in one browser. Coincidentally, this browser is made by the company that also makes the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> program. Is this just bad design or an insidious marketing ploy? Ask their attorneys.</p>
                <p>Beyond the twin plagues of page-swelling bloat and browser-specific "<abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>," there is the problem of artificial limitations imposed upon you by the designers of any <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> program you may use. Unless you work the code yourself, you cannot expand its capabilities or explore new creative terrain.</p>
                <p><em>Citizen Kane</em> was not shot with an autofocus lens. Great web pages are not built by using defaults. Use the markup, or you’ll be forced to depend on the kindness of strangers (otherwise known as software companies), to determine what you can and cannot do with your site.</p>
                <p>With an autofocus camera, the man in the striped hat will be in perfect focus; too bad if you wanted to focus on the bird in the bush. Likewise, even with an advanced <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor, your options as a designer will always be limited. Comparing <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors to autofocus cameras is probably unfair—to the cameras.</p>
                <p>Yes, these <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> programs are getting much better. Yes, a substantial number of pros do use them, particularly to rough out web pages quickly. But these pros always end up revising the end product by hand.</p>
                <h3><abbr title="What You See">WYS</abbr> Is Not Necessarily <abbr title="What You Get">WYG</abbr></h3>
                <p>With a <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> tool, if you slap an image down 30 pixels to the right of another image, it stays 30 pixels away, even if you want it to move as the user’s window widens. If you drop an image onto the exact center of the <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor page, you might think the image is "centered," but it’s not—it is stuck in an exact location, which may bear no relation whatsoever to the relative center of your users’ respective browser windows. (This is also the problem with using more advanced <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors to generate <abbr title="Dynamic HyperText Markup Language">DHTML</abbr> pages or <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-based layouts. But we’ll get to those issues in time.)</p>
                <p><abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editors give you a false sense of control and a false sense of the Web. As explained in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, the Web is not fixed like a printed page. It is fluid and variable and should be designed for accordingly. The tightly-rendered page that looks great in your <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor may look terrible on Aunt Moira’s monitor because your default fonts are larger than hers, or she doesn’t have the same fonts installed that you do, or just because she’s a silly thing who is going to leave her money to her cats, not you.</p>
                <p>Suppose we intend to create a three-column layout with an image in the center column. Using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, this is no problem—we write a three-column table, set its borders to 0, and in a few moments, we are done. If we’ve used relative widths when constructing our table (<code class="nopad">&lt;width="33%"></code> for example, instead of <code class="nopad">&lt;width="200"></code>) the design will reflow to accommodate any user’s monitor, as discussed back in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>.</p>
                <p>We can do the same thing with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and before this book reaches its second edition, that’s what we’ll all be doing. With <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> such layouts are faster and easier to achieve, and the resulting web pages render more quickly.</p>
                <p>Now let’s build the same layout in a <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> editor. We drag three columns over a grid and place our image in the middle column. Unfortunately, we were two pixels off when we dropped our image, because the program lacks a "snap-to-grid" feature (or we forgot to turn the feature on). What does the program do? It calculates an 18-column cubist mess of code, using <code class="nopad">&lt;ROWSPANS></code> and <code class="nopad">&lt;COLSPANS></code> to make sure that our mistake gets perfectly rendered.</p>
                <p>The program doesn’t know that our inexact placement of the image was an accident. The program cannot think; it can only execute, using tortured workarounds to honor our errors as hidden intentions. The result is a slow-to-download, tortuously coded fiasco—one which, after all that absurd markup and lengthy downloading, looks like garbage because the layout is subtly "off."</p>
                <p>And of course, it will never reflow to fit each user’s monitor just so.</p>
                <p>Knowing <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> doesn’t make you a web designer any more than knowing your native language makes you a writer. But choosing not to know is senseless. Don’t trust the ads. Learn the markup. If you wish to use the better <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> programs to rough out your layouts, go ahead, but be ready to get in there later and refine your code.</p>
                <h2>Browser Incompatibilities: Can't We All Just Get Along?</h2>
                <p>Not only is there no WSY in <abbr title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</abbr> web editors, there’s no guarantee that any two browsers will display your page the same way or even that your page will work in every browser. Even if you write perfectly valid and standards-compliant code, old browsers are not standards-compliant, and the dream of "write once, publish everywhere" has not yet been attained.</p>
                <p>Moreover, even on that great day when all browsers fully support <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards, extensive platform and hardware differences (as described extensively in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>) mean that the Web will remain evanescent and unfixed: a little different with each browser, in each monitor, and on each operating system. That kind of incompatibility is perfectly okay—there’s nothing we can do about it anyway. Incompatibilities that result in page failures are not okay.</p>
                <p>One thing you can do is author in accordance with commonly supported web standards instead of to "nifty new features" that work only in one browser. By definition, you will be including more people if you avoid proprietary, browser-specific markup. Given that support for these standards varies widely and browsers may legitimately differ in the way they interpret some standards, you and your company’s Quality Assurance (<abbr title="Quality Assurance">QA</abbr>) team will spend much time testing designs on a variety of browsers and platforms. (See <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, "Riding the Project Life Cycle," if you skipped it earlier.)</p>
                <p>Another thing you can do is visit The Web Standards Project (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102050037/http://webstandards.org" title="Check out what webstandards.org looked like back in 2001.">www.webstandards.org</a>), read our Mission Statement (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010331063057/http://www.webstandards.org/mission.html" title="Check out what webstandards.org/mission.html looked like back in 2001.">www.webstandards.org/mission.html</a>), and use the Project’s Resources section to learn more about standards (as well as incompatibilities). (In <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a> we’ll talk about <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> incompatibilities and how to work around them.)</p>
                <h2>Publish That Sucker!</h2>
                <p>After you have created a website, how do you publish it? You publish it by sending your files and directories to the web server. This is done by means of an <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> program, so called because it uses the File Transfer Protocol (<abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>) to do its work. Fetch is one common <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> program for the Mac; Interarchy (the <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> program formerly known as Anarchie) is another; and Panic Software’s Transmit (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240729/http://www.panic.com/transmit" title="Check out what panic.com/transmit/ looked like back in 2001.">www.panic.com/transmit/</a>) is a third—and the most Mac-like. We still use Fetch, which has not been updated since the Pleistocene era, because the crusty old tool makes us feel that we are in UNIX, and that makes us feel all hardcore and stuff. Win<abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> and Cute<abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> are common Windows <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> programs.</p>
                <p>To use an <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> program, you open it, type in the <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> address, user name, and password, and upload your files by dragging them from the open window on your desktop to the open <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> window. You can drag and drop hundreds or even thousands of files at once.</p>
                <p>Note that unlike the Mac <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>, an <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> server will not warn you if you are about to overwrite your files. Nor is there a comforting "Are you sure?" dialog box, such as in Windows. (Well, maybe the "Are you sure?" box is not comforting, exactly, but it does help prevent mistakes. <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> does not.) Existing files, if present, will simply be deleted and replaced by the new file. Many a life, or at least, a weekend, has been ruined when a web designer dragged one file on top of another. So use care when naming your files. Many web designers rename old files before they update them (personnel.html becomes, for instance, <span class="orange">personnelbak.html</span>, or <span class="orange">~personnel.html</span>).</p>
                <p>Equally important is that depending on the rules of the <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> server, text files might have to be uploaded as text, or they will not work. Image files, along with Flash movies, sound files, and so on, might have to be uploaded as binaries, or they will not work. Doddering old Fetch has a checkbox for "automatic" detection of text or binary. That checkbox is your friend. Check it and you will not be faced with the mysteries of the nonworking site.</p>
                <p>Finally, as we’ve emphasized all along, it’s important to make sure that your files end in appropriate extensions (<span class="orange">.jpg</span> for <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> images, <span class="orange">.html</span> for <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> documents, and so on) and that you have paid attention to their capitalization—or lack thereof.</p>
                <p>Offline, you can get away with mismatched cases. For example, <code class="nopad">&lt;IMG SRC="mydog.gif"></code> might work just as well as <code class="nopad">&lt;IMG SRC="MYDOG.GIF"></code> or <code class="nopad">&lt;IMG SRC="mYdOg.gIf"></code> when you’re testing the web page offline on your hard drive. But almost all web servers are case-sensitive. (Windows IIS does not seem to care one way or the other.) On most servers, if the file is named <span class="orange">mydog.gif</span> and your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> refers to <code class="nopad">&lt;MyDog.gif></code>, the image will not show up on the Web.</p>
                <p>Many web designers avoid this problem by using only lowercase for their filenames: <span class="orange">mydog.gif</span>—never <span class="orange">MyDog.gif</span> or <span class="orange">MYDOG.GIF</span>.</p>
                <p>Sticking to lowercase and coding all references in lowercase may save hours of tedious labor. You’ll also protect your clients and your site’s potential visitors. Because most folks who’ve spent time on the Web have noticed (consciously or unconsciously) that nearly all <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> are lowercase, when they hear your client’s ad they’ll type <span class="orange">http://www.widgets.com</span>. They will not type <span class="orange">HTTP://WWW.WIDGETS.COM</span>. Stick to lowercase so your client’s visitors can actually view the site.</p>
                <p>Besides, all-caps filenames are annoying. Who wants to view <span class="orange">MYDOG.GIF</span> on <span class="orange">MYHOMEPAGE.HTML</span>? Come to think of it, who wants to view <span class="orange">mydog.gif</span> on <span class="orange">myhomepage.html</span>? Never mind.</p>
                <p>One of our clients performs his own site maintenance and updating. Well, actually, many of our clients do this, but we’re not talking about those clients. We’re talking about a particular client who wreaked havoc by renaming a certain directory <code class="nopad">&lt;PRODUCTS></code> after linking to it throughout the site from its original name, <code class="nopad">&lt;products></code>. One little word, eight little letters that simply meant he got fired.</p>
                <h2>HTMHell</h2>
                <p>This chapter and the resources to which it points are not sexy because <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> is not sexy. It is a dull, baseline standard that behaves in predictable ways (give or take a few browser compatibility problems). As a web designer, you’ll be hired because of your visual skills and your thinking, not because you can upload files correctly, write good <code class="nopad">&lt;META></code> tags, or have committed the various <code class="nopad">&lt;DOCTYPES></code> to memory. Nevertheless, without a thorough understanding of <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and the ability to write it, detect and fix errors in it, and use it creatively as a design tool, you cannot be an effective web designer. So take the time to learn this simple, logical markup language before moving on to the more exciting stuff. (The exciting stuff begins in the very next chapter.)</p>
