                <h1>Visual Tools</h1>
                <p>IN THIS CHAPTER, you’ll learn how web designers use Adobe Photoshop and related software to design comps, prepare typography and images, and convert the whole shebang into working web pages. Along the way, you’ll get the lowdown on image file types, learn design techniques that make a virtue of web images’ limitations, and see how the issues of color, bandwidth, and navigation discussed earlier in this book apply to the creation of web layouts in image editors. We’ll also chat about alternative web design methods that produce lighter, more accessible sites.</p>
                <p>If you’ve read other web design books, some of the initial material in this chapter will be familiar to you, though we might take it places other books haven’t.</p>
                <p>In short—pour yourself a tall one, fluff up your seat cushions, and get ready to burrow in.</p>
                <h2>Photoshop Basics: An Overview</h2>
                <p>Coming from the world of print, most art directors and designers are familiar with Adobe Photoshop as an image editing tool. In web design, Photoshop is that and more. In fact, Photoshop, along with its included ImageReady module, is most web designers’ primary imaging, layout, and production tool.</p>
                <p>Some web designers use Macromedia Fireworks (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101060500/http://www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks" title="Check out what macromedia.com/software/fireworks/ looked like back in 2001.">www.macromedia.com/software/fireworks/</a>) to supplement or even replace Photoshop. Fireworks is a fine tool created specifically to serve the needs of web design. But as a transitioning designer or as one adding web work to an existing repertoire of design services, you will want to use the tools you know. And that means Photoshop/ImageReady and Illustrator. You will encounter Fireworks in some web agencies—Photoshop and Illustrator in all of them.</p>
                <p>We’re assuming that you already know how to open an image in Photoshop, resize it as necessary, apply color correction, make selections, run filters, save the image in a particular format, and scream when the client tells you your multilayered masterpiece is "too busy." If not, now might be a good time to brush up on your basic Photoshop skills (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010331172527/http://www.adobe.com/products/tips/photoshop.html" title="Check out what adobe.com/products/tips/photoshop.html looked like back in 2001.">http:/www.adobe.com/products/tips/photoshop.html</a>).</p>
                <p>Following is an overview of key Photoshop functions in addition to the familiar tasks of resizing, color correction, blurring, and sharpening. Material that might be new to you will be covered in detail following the overview.</p>
                <h3>Comp Preparation</h3>
                <p>Unlike in the print world, where Quark XPress, Illustrator, and InDesign hold sway, most web designers create their page layouts entirely in Photoshop. You’ll use it to conceive designs and show them to clients.</p>
                <h3>Dealing with Color Palettes</h3>
                <p>In print, color is practically unlimited. Not so on the Web. Photoshop 5.5 (or higher) and its bundled sister product, ImageReady, handle this issue with ease and grace.</p>
                <h3>Exporting to Web-Friendly Formats</h3>
                <p>Each computing platform sports a native, bitmapped image format—PICT for Mac users and <abbr title="Bitmap">BMP</abbr> for Windows. But web browsers are configured to display special, cross-platform image formats that trade quality for bandwidth. In designing web pages, you’ll use the compressed <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> formats almost exclusively. The <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> format, an open standard with advantages including alpha channel transparency, is also beginning to enjoy support in newer browsers. Photoshop exports to all these formats, with advanced functions that make your job easier. It is also a fine tool for applying image compression during the exporting process.</p>
                <h3>Gamma Compensation</h3>
                <p>Photoshop easily handles the cross-platform gamma dilemma we discussed earlier in this book. (See "Gamma, Gamma, Hey!" in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, "Designing for the Medium.")</p>
                <h3>Preparing Typography</h3>
                <p>Photoshop, together with Illustrator, enables you to prepare typographic images for the Web. Photoshop has become so adept at this task that many web designers now use it exclusively.</p>
                <h3>Slicing and Dicing</h3>
                <p>To turn a comp into a web page, most professionals find themselves slicing the comp into smaller component images and using <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup to put the pieces back together. Photoshop and ImageReady make this easy and painless, relieving you of the burden of hand-coding complexly nested <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> table cells and their associated image files.</p>
                <h3>Rollovers (Image Swapping)</h3>
                <p>The ever-popular <em>rollover</em> effect, in which one image is replaced by another when the visitor’s cursor "rolls" over it, is not just a meaningless gimmick. By emulating familiar Graphical User Interface (<abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr>) behavior, in which user actions trigger software reactions, rollovers can provide important cues to the way the site functions. Or they can just be meaningless gimmicks. Rollover effects are powered by JavaScript (or <abbr title="European Computer Manufacturers Association">ECMA</abbr>Script, as it now prefers to be called).</p>
                <p>We’ll explore JavaScript in <a href="11.html" title="Check out chapter 11.">Chapter 11</a>, "The Joy of JavaScript." While there is no substitute for learning JavaScript and employing it creatively, in this chapter you’ll learn how ImageReady can automatically generate appropriate rollover scripts for you. These rollovers can be extremely sophisticated and might exceed many web designers’ hand-programming abilities.</p>
                <h3><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> Animation</h3>
                <p>On the Web, images need not be static. Animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s create the illusion of motion without requiring visitors to download and install third-party add-ons such as Flash, Shockwave, or the Adobe <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> plug-in (not that there’s anything wrong with Flash, Shockwave, or <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>, all of which are discussed in <a href="12.html" title="Check out chapter 12.">Chapter 12</a>, "Beyond Text/Pictures").</p>
                <p><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s can contain more than one image, and the format was originally prized for its utility as a kind of multiple image storehouse. In the mid-1990s, some smart soul figured out that these multiple images could be "played" in sequence, creating the illusion of motion. The animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> was born, and the Web has never fully recovered. Photoshop’s ImageReady module enables you to easily create <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> animations. These can be free-standing, but might just as easily be incorporated into rollovers.</p>
                <h3>Create Seamless Background Patterns (Tiles)</h3>
                <p>These patterns or tiles formed a staple of web design in its early years. Many were downright ugly, and few appear in today’s sophisticated sites, but the technique can still prove useful when creatively reimagined by web designers with taste.</p>
                <p>From this brief overview, it should be clear that the Photoshop/ImageReady combo is a powerful tool for web designers. Basically, with Photoshop and your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor of choice, you can perform almost any web task.</p>
                <p>Now let’s look at some problems peculiar to web design and see how you can solve them with Photoshop and ImageReady.</p>
                <h2>Color My Web: Romancing the Cube</h2>
                <p>Glance back at <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a> for a refresher on the 216 color palette—or the Netscape Color Cube.</p>
                <p>Designers work with computers that support millions of colors. But most web users are limited to thousands (or hundreds) of colors, and your design must work well in these environments.</p>
                <p>Monitors limited to thousands of colors (16 bits) might seem to display realistic color, but it is never the actual color specified by the web designer. For mathematical reasons, colors shift slightly "off" in the 16-bit color space. This problem is insoluble and will haunt you like Jacob Marley’s ghost until cheap 24-bit graphics cards find their way into most <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s and vendors ship them configured to use the higher resolution and bit depth. (One of the tragic stupidities of the computer industry is that computers that can display millions of colors come configured to show thousands; those that can show thousands come configured to show hundreds, and so on. It’s tragic because ordinary citizens rarely realize that they can increase their <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>’s graphic power with a quick trip to the appropriate control panel.)</p>
                <p>Eight-bit (256 color) systems face an additional problem in that up to 40 of these 256 colors are "used up" in advance by the operating system itself. For instance, Windows reserves 40 (count ‘em) Windows system colors for its own display purposes. Knowing Windows, we should be glad it’s <em>only</em> 40. Nevertheless, that leaves exactly 216 colors at your disposal. (And <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, as an "indexed" file format, only supports 255 colors anyway, two of which—black and white—are always present.)</p>
                <p>What happens to viewers with lower-end graphics capabilities when you design with millions of colors they can’t see? The browser tries to simulate your color choices by combining adjacent pixels of color the visitor can see. This visual side effect is known as <em>dithering</em>, a verb that also means "babbling inconsequentially," which is kind of what we’re doing here.</p>
                <h3>Dither Me This</h3>
                <p>You’ve chosen a subtle shade of off-white for your typography. The viewer’s graphics processor cannot reproduce that exact color, so the web browser breaks up your type into a series of adjoining pink and white pixels. If the viewer squints, she will get an approximation of the color you intended to use (see Figure 9.1).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="9.1.png" alt="Figure 9.1" class="large-6 columns">
                    <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                        <h6>Figure 9.1</h6>
                        <p>The toothpaste may get teeth their whitest, but it doesn’t do much for this off-white typographic headline. On 8-bit systems, the type gets pixellated, and we suspect the web designer will, too. (Image enlarged 200%.)</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">In small, transitional areas, dithering is okay. But when it occurs across large areas of solid color—or when it is visible in the primary letterforms of typography—the result will be visually hideous, and legibility can be seriously impaired. (Usability experts and web artists alike can agree that hideous, illegible type is not a good thing.)</p>
                <p>Because the discrepancy between computers’ graphic capabilities is so enormous, it initially seems as though it would be impossible for a designer to create web pages that do not dither and degrade on most viewers’ monitors. The Color Cube saves the day (see Figure 9.2).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="9.2.png" alt="Figure 9.2" class="large-6 columns">
                    <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                        <h6>Figure 9.2</h6>
                        <p>With the typography recast in web-safe white (<span class="orange">#ffffff</span>), the headline is no longer pixellated, increasing the chances that it will actually be read. The background image is still dithered, but users of 8-bit systems will accept that. (Image enlarged 200%.)</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">For typography, <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> or <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> background colors, or any other area of large, flat color, if you stick to the web-safe color palette, you will avoid causing dithering and its resulting illegibility and aesthetic problems on 8-bit systems. As explained in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>, the practice will not help those with 16-bit systems, but nothing can save those folks except a graphics card upgrade in their future.</p>
                <h3>Death of the Web-Safe Color Palette?</h3>
                <p>Creative people complain about everything. Web designers certainly complain about being limited to 216 web-safe colors, but to us this is like griping about the nip in the air while enjoying the scenic beauty of rustic New England. You want fall foliage, so put on an extra sweater.</p>
                <p>Lulled by the music of these constant complaints, pundits perennially proclaim the death of the web-safe color palette, usually on the grounds that 16-bit systems enjoy a major market share. That 16-bit systems are widely used is undeniable: They are installed in 46% of <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s as of this writing. That the web-safe color palette is therefore dead is wishful thinking.</p>
                <p>The web-safe color palette cannot die as long as it continues to solve problems for millions of web users. It does not solve every problem, but neither does penicillin, and nobody talks about the death of penicillin. We bring this up now because you will hear about it at the office and read about it in web design newsletters, mailing lists, and bulletin boards.</p>
                <p>Who spreads these obituaries? Sometimes it’s information architects and interface developers who conduct meaningful research but draw debatable conclusions from their data. The <em>Webmonkey</em> article, "Death of the Web Safe Color Palette?" (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010207154529/http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html" title="Check out what hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html looked like back in 2001.">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/37/index2a.html</a>), proves beyond all doubt that 16-bit systems are hopelessly inadequate and invariably reveal the rabbits hiding in a web magician’s hat. But the article nihilistically concludes that all color palettes and traditional methods are meaningless in the chaos of the Web; whereas we judge simply that 16-bit users are hosed until they upgrade. Not long ago, 16-bit color was considered luxurious; cheap graphics cards changed the market, and the next generation of cheap 24-bit cards will change it again.</p>
                <p>Few discussions of the topic have been as carefully researched as <em>Webmonkey</em>’s. The death of the web-safe color palette is generally announced by the same people who tell us that bandwidth no longer matters because "everybody" will "soon" enjoy high-speed access. These folks often go on to proclaim that presently every site will be pumping out full-screen video productions to rival Hollywood blockbusters.</p>
                <p>A moment’s analysis will tell you that many people around the world are not online yet. That those who are online are mainly limited to slow connections over untrustworthy phone lines. That even in the major urban areas of industrialized nations, high-speed access is often hard to come by and frequently comes at a premium many cannot afford—or are not willing—to pay. That major Hollywood productions cost millions and can make a profit (when they <em>do</em> make a profit) only by charging admission. That websites generally do not charge admission, and web clients generally do not have millions of production dollars at their disposal. And finally, that most people do not seek big-budget entertainment from the Web. They seek information, services, and communities—all of which the Web can deliver with a minimum expenditure of bandwidth.</p>
                <p>In other words, much of what you hear about how the Web works and where it is going is bunk—including, we think, the death of the web-safe color palette. Ask us again in a year or two when (hopefully) most <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>s come standard with 24-bit color or higher.</p>
                <h3>A Hex on Both Your Houses</h3>
                <p>Reared on <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> and <abbr title="Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black">CMYK</abbr>, many designers find the Web’s hexadecimal color nomenclature strange, at first. But the predictability of recurring hexadecimal pairs (<span class="orange">00</span>, <span class="orange">33</span>, <span class="orange">66</span>, <span class="orange">99</span>, <span class="orange">cc</span>, <span class="orange">ff</span>) makes it easy to tell if you are using web-safe colors or not. It also makes it easy to specify web-safe background colors and text colors in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.</p>
                <p>You will find, after you work with these colors, that it is possible to create pleasing combinations with them, and you will develop your own techniques for doing so.</p>
                <p>In this quest, you will be greatly aided by Photoshop’s own tool set and by the VisiBone color palette included in Photoshop 5.5 and higher and available free online. The VisiBone palette is a superb tool for establishing visual relationships between web-safe colors. And, as you already know, visual relationships are the key to creating pleasing and effective color schemes.</p>
                <p>Color relationships are essential to branding, can support navigational structures, and may greatly enhance a site’s aesthetic appeal at a minimum expenditure of bandwidth. Fill an entire page with a <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> background color, devise complementary link and text colors, and you begin to have the rudiments of an attractive design using just a few kilobytes of bandwidth.</p>
                <h3>Was Blind, but Now I See</h3>
                <p>It should be noted that a small percentage of women and a larger percentage of men suffer from various forms of color blindness. Designs that rely exclusively on color to convey essential information and relationships could therefore be inaccessible to some viewers. So, while taking color extremely seriously, you must also test your designs for accessibility—ideally by running them past test subjects who manifest different forms of color blindness. If you can’t do it that way, use the Color Blindness Simulator at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101140432/http://vischeck.com" title="Check out what vischeck.com looked like back in 2001.">www.vischeck.com</a>. Viewing your web layouts in grayscale mode is a nice gesture but not a truly accurate means of testing how they will appear to, say, a person with red/green color deficit (deuteranopia).</p>
                <h3>From Theory to Practice</h3>
                <p>The following three exercises introduce you to the effects of dithering, describe how to set up the Photoshop Color Picker so that your color choices are always web-safe, and explain how to locate and install the VisiBone color palette. You will notice that we begin each exercise by cautioning you to set your monitor to 24- or 32-bit mode before launching Photoshop. If you accidentally launch Photoshop while in 16-bit mode, all your colors will shift, and the images you design for the Web will always be mismatched from their backgrounds.</p>
                <h6>Exercise 1: In a Dither</h6>
                <div class="exercise">
                    <p>Be certain your monitor is set to 24- or 32-bit mode. Launch Photoshop 5.5 or higher.</p>
                    <p>Open a new, blank document (600 x 400 pixels) and paint in it randomly, using the Paintbrush and Airbrush tools.</p>
                    <p>Also be sure to use the Type tool to set some large type in a variety of colors.</p>
                    <p>Stop when you are satisfied.</p>
                    <p>In the Mac Finder or Windows desktop, switch your monitor to 256 colors.</p>
                    <p>Look at the image you’ve created. Those ugly dots are dithering, and that’s what millions of viewers will see if you do not learn to incorporate the web-safe color palette into your work.</p>
                    <p>Close the image without saving it, quit Photoshop, and restore your monitor to its normal color settings (millions of colors).</p>
                </div>
                <h6>Exercise 2: You Sure Can Pick 'em</h6>
                <div class="exercise">
                    <p>Be certain your monitor is set to 24- or 32-bit mode. Launch Photoshop 5.5 or higher.</p>
                    <p>Open a new, blank document (600 x 400 pixels).</p>
                    <p>Open Photoshop’s Color Picker (see Figure 9.3). Note the Only Web Colors checkbox and check it.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="9.3.png" alt="Figure 9.3" class="large-6 columns">
                        <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                            <h6>Figure 9.3</h6>
                            <p>The Photoshop Color Picker provides <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr>, <abbr title="Hue, Saturation, Brightness">HSB</abbr>, Lab, <abbr title="Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black">CMYK</abbr>, and hexadecimal readouts for any color you choose. The familiarity of <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> and <abbr title="Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black">CMYK</abbr> will help acclimate you to hexadecimal nomenclature. Click the checkbox that reads Only Web Colors, and your choices will always be web-safe.</p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p class="clearfix">Watch your universe of color options shrink down to 216 choices. On the plus side, the various graphic dialogs help you see the relationships between web-safe colors.</p>
                    <p>Close the Color Picker dialog.</p>
                    <p>From now on, <em>Photoshop’s Color Picker will always be web-safe</em>. You can also use Photoshop’s Color Picker to shift a near-web-safe color so that it is fully web-safe.</p>
                    <p>Photoshop’s web-safe Color Picker is a vast improvement over what the program used to offer in the way of support (namely, nothing).</p>
                    <p>Now that our Color Picker is web-safe, let’s do the same for our color palette dialog. Jeepers, but we are moving along quickly here.</p>
                </div>
                <h6>Exercise 3: Rolling the ‘Bones</h6>
                <div class="exercise">
                    <p>Be certain your monitor is set to 24- or 32-bit mode. Launch Photoshop 5.5 or higher.</p>
                    <p>Open a new, blank document (600 x 400 pixels).</p>
                    <p>Refer to the Colors dialog. Note that there is a web-safe palette included in Photoshop. Note that the color combinations are not especially intuitive and have no meaningful relationship with the color wheel or other color theory models.</p>
                    <p>Let’s fix that.</p>
                    <p>In the Swatches dialog box, choose Replace Swatches. A dialog box opens, allowing you to navigate to a new palette located on your hard drive. Steer your way to the VisiBone color palette (VisiBone1.aco), which is most likely located in Adobe Photoshop 5.5, Goodies, Color Swatches.</p>
                    <p>Handsome, isn’t it? (See Figure 9.4.)</p>

                            <p>The VisiBone color palette, located in the Color Swatches folder within the Goodies folder in Photoshop 5.5 and higher, makes it easy to choose harmonious or contrasting colors from within the web-safe palette. Don’t leave home without it.</p>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p class="clearfix">This is still the web-safe color palette. But unlike Photoshop’s built-in, default version, the VisiBone palette offers a meaningful arrangement built around the color wheel model we all learned about in school (unless we spent our time in school doodling and learned almost nothing except how to draw guitars in the margins of our textbooks). Colors move in a circle across the spectrum, and related colors are geometrically aligned with respect to one another.</p>
                    <p>The VisiBone color palette not only helps you choose web-safe colors, it helps you choose web-safe colors <em>that relate to one another in a meaningful way, man</em>. Harmonious and contrasting color relationships are easy to see and thus easier to create.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the VisiBone palette helps you start doing beautiful work within the limitations of the Color Cube. For instance, it helps you quickly find a web-safe approximation of a client’s logo color and begin experimenting with complementary and contrasting web-safe colors for your layouts. (It goes without saying that if original logo development is part of the project, you will design the logo using web-safe colors. It also goes without saying that your client might want you to design a logo that matches the color of their new Beetle or their favorite coffee mug, but that is where tact and client education come in.)</p>
                    <p>Save the VisiBone swatch so it is always available when you work in Photoshop.</p>
                    <p>Now pat yourself on the back. Many of your peers have no idea that this special swatch exists, that it comes bundled with Photoshop, and that it can greatly ease the creation of meaningful and attractive color schemes for the Web. You are ahead of the game.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If you’re stuck using an older version of Photoshop or an alternative image editor, you can download the VisiBone palette free of charge at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101190046/http://www.visibone.com" title="Check out what visibone.com looked like back in 2001.">www.visibone.com</a>. While there, help yourself to additional VisiBone palettes for other software programs you or your teammates use, including Adobe Illustrator and ImageReady, Macromedia Fireworks, Bare Bones BBEdit, Jasc Paint Shop Pro, Allaire HomeSite, MetaCreations Painter, or the GIMP (an image editor for Linux). You need it; they’ve got it.</p>

You also might want to buy Weinman’s <em>Designing Web Graphics</em> and <em>Coloring Web Graphics</em>, both of which are available from New Riders Press, and are pretty much the standard industry texts. They are full of practical examples and offer stimulating and innovative ideas from the earliest days of web design.</p>
                <p>Another standard industry text, David Siegel’s <em>Creating Killer Websites</em>, is also available from New Riders and also provides extensive information on the subjects we cover in this chapter. It’s a beautifully written book full of great ideas, but it is also a book of its time (1996), and many of the practices it preaches would now be considered harmful to the development of a semantic Web based on <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Recommendations. We own and cherish this book, which was greatly influential in our development, and we recommend it as long as you know which of its visual techniques to shun. (If you’re unsure, wait for the book’s third Edition...we hear it’s coming soon.)</p>
                <h2>Format This: <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s, and Such</h2>
                <p>Raster images come in at least as many formats as there are software programs and operating systems. On the Web, however, we tend to use two formats almost exclusively: <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>. (As explained previously, animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are a special instance of the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format.)</p>
                <p><abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> is yet another web format, one that has been little supported in the past. Some newer browsers have begun to support <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>, though it is still far from ubiquitous. We will discuss it after thoroughly examining the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> formats—how they work, which types of images they deliver best, and how you can evolve strong stylistic concepts by understanding their limitations.</p>
                <h3><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr></h3>
                <p>The Graphics Interchange Format (<abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>) is older than the Web. In fact it is older than some web designers. <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> was developed in the 1980s by CompuServe, and you’ll often hear old-timers speak of "CompuServe <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s." You’ll also hear them talk about walking 12 miles to a one-room schoolhouse.</p>
                <p>The Compuserve folks pronounced the word as if it were the name of the peanut butter ("Jiff") and because they were the inventors, that is the correct pronunciation. Millions of people pronounce <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> with a hard "G," however, so you might as well be a sniveling conformist and spend the rest of your career mispronouncing <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> while secretly suffering great guilt over it. <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are usually seen with a <span class="orange">.GIF</span> file extension, as in <span class="orange">payme.GIF</span> or <span class="orange">payme.gif</span>.</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format renders in 8-bit color or lower, at your discretion. Two-color <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are not uncommon. <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> permits you to achieve crude transparency effects by marking one of your 216 (or fewer) colors as "transparent." However, you must take care to anti-alias the foreground image against the transparent color, lest mismatched halos surround your graphics. Fortunately, <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> renders specific colors exactly, so it is an easy matter to match web page backgrounds to image backgrounds. The only caveat there is the previously mentioned heartbreak of 16-bit systems.</p>
                <p>Above all, <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> enables you to save bandwidth without sacrificing quality. It employs the <em>Unisys-patented Lempel Ziv Welch (<abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr>) algorithm</em> (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010412031956/http://www.dogma.net/markn/articles/lzw/lzw.htm" title="Check out what dogma.net/markn/articles/lzw/lzw.htm looked like back in 2001.">www.dogma.net/markn/articles/lzw/lzw.htm</a>) to efficiently compress solid color areas while preserving crisp detail. Though the format necessarily discards colors—for instance, when rendering a 24-bit image as a 16-color <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>—it does not blur or eliminate significant image details. For this reason, the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> algorithm produces what is known as <em>lossless compression</em>.</p>
                <h4>Loves logos, typography, and long walks in the woods</h4>
                <p>This combination of crisp detail and efficient compression makes <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> the format of choice for line art including typography, logos, and illustrations. As mentioned earlier, the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format can also be used to create animated images. When combined with JavaScript rollovers, animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s can lend life and dynamism to a website. They can also create nausea and ennui. With animation and rollovers, as with Tabasco, a little goes a long way.</p>
                <p>Animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s have been supported in all graphical web browsers since Netscape 2.0 (1995), and nonanimated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s have been supported in graphical web browsers since before time began. For now we will continue to discuss the merits and uses of static (nonanimated) <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s.</p>
                <p>In spite of the fact that <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are found on millions of sites, the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format is not a <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>-recommended web standard. That’s because <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> gets its power from a patented algorithm. Unisys, the patent holder, is entitled to charge royalties on any software that employs the <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> algorithm—in other words, any software that can read or write <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s. The revelation of Unisys’ right to charge a "<abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> tax" spread panic among early web designers when it became widely known only after the entire Web seemed to be built with <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images. It also led to the development of <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>, a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>-like format with more advanced features and a nonproprietary compression algorithm.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> "royalties" do not work in the way that, say, photo rights work. You do not pay a fee each time you create a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image. Instead, software companies such as Adobe, Macromedia, and Corel render these tributes to Caesar. You pay your share one time only, and it is hidden in the purchase price of Photoshop, Fireworks, or any other software program that exports to the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are <em>not</em> the format of choice for photography, paintings, and other subtly modulated images because they lack sufficient colors to reproduce these types of images and because the nuances in those images do not lend themselves to <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression. Photographic images tend to render better in the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format (or <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>), and we’ll get to those formats soon enough.</p>
                <h4><abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s in Photoshop</h4>
                <p>In Photoshop, you can choose whether to save your image as a standard or interlaced <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>. The standard format is like a reader, taking in one letter after another, one word after another, one sentence after another. Standard <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s store and display the bytes comprising an image’s pixels in their order of appearance: The first pixel in is the first pixel out. Thus, standard <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s scroll onto the viewer’s screen pixel by pixel and line by line.</p>
                <p>The interlaced format is like a nervous reader who keeps skipping ahead—from paragraph one to paragraph five, then back to paragraph one. Interlaced <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s load in a parallel rather than linear sequence, allowing the total image to be rendered more quickly and then with greater detail as additional pixels are downloaded. This allows viewers to get a sense of the image before it has finished downloading.</p>
                <p>Under the right conditions, interlaced <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s might thus appear to load faster—and so may your site. The appearance is deceptive given that interlaced <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are often a few bytes <em>larger</em> than standard <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s and therefore take a fractionally longer time to fully download. Moreover, the slight benefits of interlaced <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s often evaporate when other conditions are factored in.</p>
                <p>For one thing, the effectiveness of progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s depends on the viewer’s access speed. With a super-fast connection, images load so quickly that any progressive rendering benefits are lost. The format was something of a godsend not so long ago, when most web users were limited to 14.4 modems. Today, few are stuck with such abysmal speeds.</p>
                <p>The effectiveness of progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s also depends on the browser. Some browsers do not show anything at all until all images are fully loaded; in those browsers, the progressive aspects of the image are entirely wasted. If anything, in such browsers, progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s delay the page by adding a few bytes to the overall download time.</p>
                <p>Some browsers, such as Internet Explorer, give users a choice. Users may view each image as it downloads (best with slow connections), or they may choose to wait for the entire page to download and assemble itself in memory before appearing full-blown on the screen (best with fast connections). Users choose a viewing method in the Explorer Preferences dialog box. You have no way of knowing or controlling these user preferences.</p>
                <p>Beginning web designers often ask if they can control the loading order of images on a web page. Given what has just been explained, the answer is obviously "no," because web users can choose (or their browsers may force them) to wait for the entire page to load. Beyond that, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> has no means of controlling the loading order of images. And even if it did support such nuances, the unpredictability of <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> calls (explained in <a href="2.html" title="Check out Chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>) means that one image might halt in mid-download, not even appearing until another, called much later, has already popped into place. The more images per page, the greater the randomness of load order. View a busy thumbnail image gallery sometime to see this in action, assuming your browser allows you to watch images download one by one.</p>
                <p>Avoid progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s when creating an image to be used as a background. Backgrounds do not appear until they have fully downloaded, so any "progressive" effects will be lost. Moreover, progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> backgrounds can crash some older browsers.</p>
                <p>Progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s also can be hazardous to animations because each succeeding frame of a progressive animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> will appear blurry, thus defeating the effort to create smooth motion effects.</p>
                <p>They’re not great for JavaScript rollovers, either. You can offset the harmful, blurred quality of progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s in rollovers by preloading the images, a technique explained in the <a href="11.html" title="Check out chapter 11">Chapter 11</a>, "The Joy of JavaScript." When preloaded via JavaScript, images download and are stored in the viewer’s cache even though they do not appear on the web page until triggered by some action on the viewer’s part (typically, moving the mouse over an image to which rollover effects have been applied). Any sane web designer who creates rollovers starts by preloading the alternate (replacement) images. But if the images are going to be preloaded anyway, there’s no sense in having them render progressively because the user will never see them until they have fully downloaded and cached.</p>
                <p>One last tip while we’re in this area. Given that text loads instantly and images take time (see <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a>), designs that use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text above the fold will appear to load more quickly than those that bury their text further down on the screen. A web user waiting for images is a web user with nothing to do (except, perhaps, hit the Back button). A web user reading text has less anxiety about the fact that some images may not have finished downloading. With sufficiently engaging text, the user will feel that the site is responsive. Keep this in mind when designing sites that require a great many images.</p>
                <h3><abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>, the Other White Meat</h3>
                <p>The Joint Photographic Experts Group (<abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>) format should be familiar to you from stock photo houses, digital cameras, and the Photoshop tutorial itself. Usually seen with a <span class="orange">.jpg</span> file extension (as in <span class="orange">landscape.jpg</span>), <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> supports 24-bit color and preserves the subtle hue and brightness variations found in photographs and other continuous-tone images. <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> is therefore usually the format of choice when creating photographic images for the Web. Like <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> is widely supported in visual web browsers.</p>
                <p>Just as <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> music files toss away audio harmonics to achieve compact file sizes, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>’s compression works by selectively discarding bits of image data. Because a loss of quality is involved, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> compression is referred to as <em>lossy compression</em>. "Lossy" is an annoying word that looks wrong, but we appear to be stuck with it. In theory, the material discarded by the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> optimization process is data that is nearly invisible to the human eye (just as audio data discarded by the <abbr title="MPEG Audio Layer III">MP3</abbr> format is supposed to go practically undetected by your ears, though we’ve never met a music fan who could not hear the difference). The greater the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> compression, however, the more visible the "missing data" becomes. At extremely high compression ratios, <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> images can display funky artifacts (see Figures 9.5 and 9.6).</p>
                <p>Although <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> is generally preferred for photographic images, when sharp detail is important, <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> is the better choice. <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> tends to soften images as it compresses them. Particularly when you are working with typography, the softness of <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> images can ruin the effect of a web graphic. Naturally, there is a workaround, as explained in the "Combining Sharp and Blurry" section later in this chapter.</p>
                <p>Unlike <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format does not retain specific web-safe (or other) colors. It promises you a rose garden, but the rose might be umber. In a silhouetted portrait where the edges of the image must match the background of the web page, you would therefore use <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, not <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>.</p>

                        <p>At high <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> compression levels, file size is low (minimizing bandwidth) but so is the quality. Each <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> optimization is an exercise in balancing file size versus quality of detail.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">Photoshop’s Save For Web function provides a small, Matte Color dialog box that purports to save an exact background color of your choice, even in the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format. (Skip ahead to Figure 9.7, if you must. The Matte Color dialog appears at mid-right.)</p>
                <p>Photoshop does all it can to fulfill this promise, but the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format really is not built to handle specific colors like this. To viewers with 24-bit and higher systems, the background color will appear to match. For 16-bit and lower users, the mismatch may be clearly visible. So stick with <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> when you absolutely, positively, have to deliver a specific web-safe (or other) color.</p>
                <p>In Photoshop, you can choose whether to save your <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> as a baseline (standard) <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> or as a <em>progressive</em> <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>. Progressive <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s display a low-resolution version of the image almost immediately and then gradually come into crisper focus.</p>
                <p>As with progressive <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s, under the right circumstances, progressive <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s can create the illusion that the site is loading faster. As previously discussed, this varies depending on the viewer’s access speed, browser functionality, browser preferences, and the caprices of <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr>. And as in the discussion of <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s above, when intended as background images, progressive <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s are a no-no unless you want some of your visitors to crash-crash.</p>
                <h3>Optimizing <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s</h3>
                <p>When we export images such as <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s and <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s, we choose the format most appropriate to the type of image we’re dealing with and then optimize it to create the best appearance possible, while using the least amount of bandwidth and computing resources.</p>
                <p>In addition to <em>optimizing</em> (reducing file sizes), the exporting process allows us to further exert control over the color of our <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> images.</p>
                <p>Photoshop 3, 4, and 5 offered early web designers very little in the way of optimization and color controls. As a result, a number of inexpensive, third-party, shareware plug-in products specifically tailored to the needs of web designers sprang up in the mid-1990s, most notably Boxtop Software’s PhotoGIF, ImageVice, and Pro<abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> (all are available at <a href="" title="Unfortunately this link is dead. :-(">www.boxtop-software.com</a>). These products were dandy (still are), but they did not come as standard equipment (still don’t). Arguably, they do a better job than Photoshop at handling some tasks.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, Photoshop 5.5 and higher, together with ImageReady, offers a number of tools to help web designers create the best-looking image while using the least amount of bandwidth. Photoshop’s Save For Web command (found in File, Save For Web) enables web designers to preview the effects of various compression settings on their images and then execute those settings and save the resulting web-ready images (see Figure 9.7).</p>
                <p>The Save For Web dialog is powerfully compelling in the breadth and subtlety of its tools. You can preview <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> versions using as few as two colors, as many as 256, or anything in between. You can use Adaptive, Selective, Perceptual, or web-safe color, with or without dithering, transparency, or interlacing (the "progressive" setting). You can skew images closer to or further from the web-safe palette as you desire. You also can name and save custom settings for later application to similar images.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="9.7.png" alt="Figure 9.7" class="large-6 columns">

Shift one color at a time to its closest web-safe equivalent. We feel like press agents. We feel giddy. We love this dialog box. You will too.</p>
                <p>Images in Save For Web mode also may be previewed at various <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> settings, both baseline and progressive, and again the tools are remarkably powerful.</p>
                <p>In general, the fewer the colors used in a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, the better it compresses. This is not because the color palettes themselves eat bandwidth; rather it is because of the way <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression works. More on that in a moment in the "Expanding on Compression" section that is coming up next.</p>
                <p>Dithering images produces more photographic-like effects at the cost of slightly higher file sizes; images without dithering are smaller. We find that typographic <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are often cleaner and more legible when saved without dithering. Your mileage may vary. You can create either type of image (and preview the results) in Photoshop’s Save For Web dialog box.</p>
                <p>After you decide which optimization scheme works best for a given image, the image can be saved in that format. Your chosen settings may be retained indefinitely, and can even be applied (as a droplet) to an entire folder of images.</p>
                <p>Photoshop lets you name and store as many of these settings as you like. If a series of images you’ve created for Acme Widgets happens to work well in 12 colors with no dithering at <span class="orange">60% web-safe</span>, you can name that setting <span class="orange">12color_nodither</span> (or <span class="orange">acme_widgets</span> or <span class="orange">60websafe</span> or <span class="orange">donaldduck</span> if you prefer). You can then save it forever—or at least until your backup media deteriorates and what’s left of your hair is white and listless. By then we’ll all be living on Mars while our clones do the work, anyway.</p>
                <p>Alternately, you can use the ImageReady module to satisfy your wanton image compression and formatting needs. But Photoshop’s Save For Web is just as effective, and the true power of ImageReady comes later in the process (and this chapter).</p>
                <h3>Expanding on Compression</h3>
                <p>As explained previously, we compress images to minimize wasted bandwidth and speed the arrival of the web page. We’ve shown you how Photoshop optimizes images when preparing them for the Web, so you know all you need to know to handle the basics. The following are some extra tips.</p>
                <h4>Make your <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>S smaller</h4>
                <p>You can make your <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s even smaller in file size (and reduce the appearance of <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> artifacts) by blurring them slightly before compressing them. Not all areas of all images react well to blurring, but it’s surprising what you can achieve by blurring, say, a distant sky and sunset while preserving the sharpness of a human subject in the foreground.</p>
                <p>This kind of work requires selecting the parts of the image you want to blur, feathering the edge of the selection slightly, and masking out the parts of the image where sharper focus is important. As we said in the beginning, we assume you already know how to do these things in Photoshop.</p>
                <p>If you prefer, you can apply subtle (or not-so-subtle) blurring effects to your entire image in the Save For Web dialog box, but we generally find this method too coarse. Blurring, say, an entire portrait makes the subject look drunk—or the viewer feel that way. Selectively and subtly blurring large areas of undifferentiated skin tones, while preserving the sharpness of eyes, brows, hair, and lips, will usually be much more effective. And that kind of work you do in the main Photoshop window before entering the Save For Web dialog.</p>
                <h4>Combining sharp and blurry</h4>
                <p>Subtle problems can arise when choosing the appropriate image format. Say you’ve designed a header graphic that includes both photography (a shot of the corporate board of directors) and typography (a superimposed headline in Meta or Helvetica Neu Condensed Black). The headline requires sharp focus and crisp handling—thus it begs to be a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>. The photograph wants to be a <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>. What’s a mother to do?</p>
                <p>Usually, what you do is give greater weight to the need for crisp typography and export the entire image as a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, accepting that the photographic imagery will not render as well as it would have in a <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> (see Figures 9.8, 9.9, and 9.10).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="9.8.png" alt="Figure 9.8" class="large-6 columns">
                    <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                        <h6>Figure 9.8</h6>
                        <p>The background image, a layered photomontage, wants to be saved as a <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> because <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> would best reproduce its subtly modulating hue and brightness variations. But…</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>

                        <p>…the typography insists on being saved as a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> because only the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format will reproduce the crisp, clear lines of type.

                        <p>…the image is saved as a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> because type takes precedence over photographic nuances. The image could also have been saved as a <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>. But the <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> would have been far larger and not enough browsers fully support the <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> format yet.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">Alternately, you could export the human subjects as a <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>, export the typography as a transparent <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, and superimpose the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> over the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> using any number of web sleights of hand. For instance, you could employ <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> absolute positioning to layer a crisp, transparent typographic <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> on top of a soft photographic <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>. (This would not work in Netscape 3 or <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr>3 and might destabilize Netscape 4. Thankfully, these browsers are finally limping away from the playing field, although not as fast as we’d like.)</p>
                <p>Depending on the layout, you alternatively could use the old, nonstandard <code class="nopad">&lt;bgimage></code> attribute of the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> table cell <code class="nopad">&lt;td></code> tag to position a photographic image in the background of a table cell and then place a type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> in the foreground. The type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> would have to be the same size as the background image and would require <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> transparency to allow the background to peek through. The size of the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> would be marked up in the table cell attributes to ensure that the cell was the correct size. Though this technique works well in almost every graphic browser since the svelte boyhood of Fred Flintstone, it is a lot of silly (and nonstandard) markup—and it’s probably not worth the bandwidth.</p>
                <p>Or you could do what Magdalena Donnea did on the front page of her award-winning personal site, "Water," at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20000824120437/http://www.kia.net/water" title="Check out what kia.net/water/ looked like back in 2000.">www.kia.net/water/</a>. (Use View Source to see exactly what Magdalena did.)</p>
                <p>As we said, most of the time, you’ll use the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format to ensure that your text is legible. You also might consider rethinking the entire design idea in favor of one that is more in keeping with the limitations of the Web (see Figure 9.11).</p>

                        <p>The ever-popular "striped" effect that dominated the web in the late 1990s had its roots in a technique to minimize bandwidth by making the most of the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> compression algorithm’s preference for straight horizontal lines.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <h2 class="clearfix">Compression Breeds Style: Thinking About the Medium</h2>
                <p>The <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format not only compresses by removing millions of colors, it also employs the <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> algorithm to keep track of those colors and further reduce file sizes. A clever web designer can create large images that use little bandwidth by designing with <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression in mind. To understand how that is possible, we must take a closer look at how <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression actually works.</p>
                <p>Onscreen images are like diners inside a burger joint. A mentally challenged waiter says, "The first gentleman at Table One would like a cheeseburger. The second gentleman at Table One would like a cheeseburger. The third gentleman at Table One would like a cheeseburger. The fourth gentleman at Table One would like a cheeseburger."</p>
                <p>This is how a noncompressed image works. The computer looks up the color of a pixel and then displays it. It looks up the color of the adjoining pixel and displays that—and so on and so on for every pixel on the screen.</p>
                <p>A smart waiter says, "Four cheeseburgers," which is how <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression works.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression looks at an image line by line and says, "Row #1 is all red pixels" (assuming that Row #1 actually <em>is</em> all red pixels). Obviously, the greater the number of pixel rows that are identical to each other, the better the compression engine works (for example, four tables of four cheeseburgers). Thus, horizontal and vertical elements compress better than diagonal elements because with horizontal or vertical elements, more rows of pixels can be exactly the same as each other.</p>
                <p>Without getting too technical, horizontal lines tend to compress even better than vertical ones because <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression "reads" images left to right and line by line, the same way you’re reading this book. If every pixel in a given line is the same color, that line compresses better, and therefore so does the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> (there’s more to it than that, of course). Ten lines containing all the same color compress better still. Basically, <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> compression likes large areas of flat color, whether they are confined to a single line or bleed down across several. The main point is that an image containing one or more lines of identically colored pixels will compress much better than the average image whose colors are arrayed at random.</p>
                <p>In 1995, when 14.4 modems prevailed, some clever web designers began masking every other horizontal line in an image to maximize <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression and minimize bandwidth. This technique of masking images with evenly spaced horizontal lines is known as CRLI compression (<a href="" title="Unfortunately this link is dead. :-(">www.infohiway.com/faster/crli.html</a>).</p>
                <p>What started out as a bandwidth-oriented tool had become a stylistic design fetish by the late 1990s, as newcomers to the field fell in love with the CRLI "look" without understanding its utilitarian purpose as a tool of bandwidth compression. To these designers, stripes were "webby," and "webby" was cool. As the Web exploded into public consciousness, consumers and ad agencies seemed to agree with this link between "Web" and "cool." The ever-popular striped effect was soon seen not only all over the Web, but also in print and television.</p>
                <p>Among many ironies, some web designers exported these striped images in the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> format, where, far from saving bandwidth, the technique actually wasted it. They knew not what they were doing. CRLI compression is a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> thing, baby.</p>
                <p>The strengths and limitations of <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression are equally profound. For instance, because <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> prefers straight horizontal and vertical lines to all others, Roman type tends to reproduce better than oblique. Roman type is also better at hiding its anti-aliasing artifacts at screen resolutions—another reason it works better onscreen than oblique does.</p>
                <p>Considering these limitations of the medium may lead you to set your headlines in Roman type more often than oblique. Of course, Roman type is far more frequently used than oblique to begin with, so this situation is hardly tragic. But you should be aware of it. Oblique type can certainly be used for headlines—we do it all the time—but it never reproduces as well as upright type.</p>
                <p>You will run into the same difficulty with lines at almost every angle. The 45-degree angle is the exception: It works perfectly with <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr>, like a diagonal in a game of tic-tac-toe. As you might expect, 45-degree angles came into vogue around 1999 because they reproduce well on the Web, and within six months they were popping up in print and <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> as a meaningless design fetish after everyone had tired of the striped effect. And as you might also expect, many web designers employed 45-degree angles in <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s, then saved the <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s at the highest possible quality settings to preserve the crispness of their lines. The result: wasted bandwidth.</p>
                <h3><abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr></h3>
                <p>The <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> format was developed in hopes of establishing it as an open standard for graphics on the Web—which it now is (see <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101232356/http://www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG" title="Check out what w3.org/Graphics/PNG/ looked like back in 2001.">www.w3.org/Graphics/PNG/</a>). But while <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> was slowly being developed, working web designers had to create websites, and all browsers supported <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s. In effect, then, <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> is a long-standing, unofficial <em>defacto</em> standard based on a proprietary compression algorithm, while <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> is a nonproprietary, officially sanctioned standard that is not as well supported as it ought to be.</p>
                <p>There are two forms of <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>. <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>-8 is an 8-bit format (like <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>). <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>-24 offers 24-bit color (like <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>), yet its sharpness and quality put <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> to shame. To create <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> images for the Web, simply choose <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>-24 or <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>-8, 128 Dithered in Photoshop’s Save For Web dialog box or in ImageReady.</p>
                <p><abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> is still not natively supported in enough web browsers, and though support is growing, <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> is unlikely to supplant <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> or <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr> any time soon. For one thing, <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr>, while high in quality, is often high in bandwidth as well. For another, while <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> stays crisp in milk (like <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s do), the <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> format does not support animation. <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are therefore seen as more versatile by those who even bother to lift their heads out of their cubicles and think about these issues.</p>
                <p>To see why <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> can be cool indeed, if your browser can handle it, visit the Audio site at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102022025/http://www.panic.com/audion/faces.php" title="Check out what panic.com/audion/faces.php looked like back in 2001.">www.panic.com/audion/faces.php</a>, click any thumbnail, and a <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> image will pop up on the screen.

                <h2>Animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s</h2>
                <p>Animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are nothing more than a series of frames (or individual <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s) that have been joined together to create the illusion of motion. They can loop endlessly or play once and then stop. We could include a screenshot here, but what’s the point? If you haven’t seen animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s, you’ve never used the Web. (Hint: look at the ad banners that clutter most commercial content sites—web animation in a nutshell.)</p>
                <p>Although the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format supported the embedding of multiple images in the late 1980s, it was not until 1995 or so that Netscape figured out how to hack the format’s multi-image capability to create flip-book-style animation. (Basically, Netscape did this by appropriating a Comments field and some unused but reserved bits in the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>89A file format.)</p>
                <p>Back in the day, web designers used free shareware tools to create animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s, after first preparing each individual image, saving it as a <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>, and then running all resulting <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s through DeBabelizer, a cumbersome color management tool that ensured that the colors would match between frames. (Nothing ruins the illusion of motion faster than an unexplained color shift between one frame and the next.)</p>
                <p>Today all that work is merely a memory because Photoshop comes with ImageReady, and ImageReady makes it easy to create, optimize, and save <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> animations.</p>
                <p>Animation for its own sake is charmless, abrasive, and amateurish. Good web designers use animation as they use everything else: with taste and skill in support of a concept and brand image. The creators of <a href="//web.archive.org/web/20010208100804/http://www.k10k.net/issue100celebration/1/index.htm" title="Check out what k10k.net looked like back in 2001.">www.k10k.net</a> employ animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s well. The animations are revealed when rolling over the miniature content header graphics.</p>
                <p>Care should be taken to avoid wasting bandwidth when creating animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s. If one image uses x bytes, then ten images theoretically use 10x bytes, and your web page might bloat as a result. Fortunately, web designers can trim excess fat from their animations by telling the software to animate only the parts that change, rather than redrawing each frame in its entirety. This process is explained in the next sections. Web designers also can optimize their animations by leaving out inessential in-between frames, by keeping their images small (50 x 50 is better than 100 x 100), and by creating graphics that can be rendered in as few colors as possible.</p>
                <h2>Creating Animations in ImageReady</h2>
                <p>Adobe ImageReady simplifies the process of creating animated <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s by allowing web designers to use Photoshop’s layers as a series of frames and enabling them to manually change the location of elements from one frame to the next.</p>
                <p>For instance, if you wish to animate an arrow, you can draw the arrow on one layer in Photoshop then jump to ImageReady and open the animation palette. Create a new frame and drag the arrow manually to the left or right. Create a third frame and drag the arrow again. ImageReady "remembers" the location of each arrow and will render an animation as a result of these manual movements.</p>
                <p>ImageReady can also generate tweens automatically. Start with an arrow on the left. Create a new frame. Drag the arrow to the right. Choose the Tween command and instruct ImageReady to tween between the first and second frames. ImageReady generates a smooth flow of images. You can then use the Optimize palette to ensure color consistency from the first frame to the last. Keep in mind that the more you tween, the smoother the motion but the larger the overall file size.</p>
                <p>We could blab on about this, but the Photoshop owner’s manual does a great job of explaining everything. The way we see it, if you own Photoshop, read the manual. If you don’t own it, there’s no sense in reading about it here and probably not much sense in planning a web design career. (Gosh, that sounds like a product endorsement.)</p>
                <h2>Typography</h2>
                <p>A designer’s interest in typography usually borders on obsession. On the Web, you’ll get plenty of opportunities to indulge your fetish. As part of establishing the look and feel of a site, the web designer is responsible for all of its typographic choices, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Body text typography (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>)</span></li>
                    <li><span>Logo (if not preexisting)</span></li>
                    <li><span>"Type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>" headlines, subheads, and so on</span></li>
                    <li><span>Navigational typography (menu bar)</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Body text typography is controlled with Cascading Style Sheets (<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>), a subject so important we devote an entire chapter to it (<a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>, "Style Sheets for Designers") and still scarcely do it justice. All we’ll do here is remind you that 99% of the Web is text, most of it intended to be read, and that there is neither a reason nor an excuse to create hard-to-read text on your web pages.</p>
                <p>The logo, if not preexisting, will be designed in Adobe Illustrator or Macromedia Freehand, just as it would be in print projects. All we need to say about that is to remember to start with web-safe colors, keep your design simple so it can reproduce at small sizes (32 x 32 web buttons, for instance), and pay attention to the following discussion about serif versus sans serif faces in the limited 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> screen environment.</p>
                <p>Remember the VisiBone color palette we mentioned earlier in this chapter? Download the Illustrator version and use it to develop logos and other graphics intended for the Web.</p>
                <p>Before copying Illustrator artwork to Photoshop, convert to <abbr title="Red, Green, Blue">RGB</abbr> via Illustrator’s Filter, Colors menu. The process is not perfect; web-safe colors may shift, and you might need to select large areas in Photoshop and refill them with web-safe colors.</p>
                <p>The main thrust of our look at typography will not be body text (covered in <a href="10.html" title="Check out chapter 10.">Chapter 10</a>) or logo design (covered previously in this chapter). Instead, we will discuss the basics of using Adobe Photoshop and ImageReady to create typographic <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s for the Web. We’ll also further examine how anti-aliasing can work for or against your web designs.</p>
                <h2>The ABCs of Web Type</h2>
                <p>As you know, Photoshop and ImageReady let you add horizontal and vertical type to any image. As of Photoshop 5.5, you can specify the typeface, leading, kerning, tracking, baseline style, size, and alignment of the type and edit its characters. Photoshop 6 improves on its predecessor’s already remarkable power.</p>
                <p>Previously, such details as leading, kerning, and tracking were the exclusive province of Illustrator, and most serious web designers would create their typography in Illustrator and then cut and paste it into Photoshop. Some still do that, and you might prefer to as well. Illustrator offers useful keyboard shortcuts for kerning and other typographic functions. Many of those keyboard shortcuts are missing from Photoshop, making the process a bit less streamlined.</p>
                <p>But keyboard shortcuts aside, Photoshop has advanced tremendously in its handling of type and now offers essentially the same typographic functionality that Illustrator does. As a result, many designers use Photoshop for everything.</p>
                <p>Photoshop 5.5 and higher also allows you to select an anti-aliasing option for type, apply simulated styles to type, and turn off fractional character widths to improve the appearance of small, bitmapped type displayed at low resolution.</p>
                <h3>Anti-Aliasing</h3>
                <p>As all designers know, <em>anti-aliasing</em> enables you create the appearance of smooth-edged type by partially filling in the edge pixels with intermediary colors. For those who don’t know, we provide the following handy exercise.</p>
                <h6>Exercise 4: The Great Intermediary</h6>
                <div class="exercise">
                    <p>Launch Photoshop and create a new blank document with a white background. Work at 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr>. (We always work at 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> on the Web.)</p>
                    <p>Select the type tool. Click in the image to set an insertion point.</p>
                    <p>Enter some text in the Type Tool dialog box (Photoshop 5.5) or directly on the image (Photoshop 6). Format the text however you like. For the sake of argument, we’ll type our names in black, 24<abbr title="point">pt</abbr>. Helvetica. "Crisp" anti-aliasing is chosen by default. (If it is not, choose it now.)</p>
                    <p>Close the Type dialog.</p>
                    <p>Go to Photoshop’s Navigator menu and blow up the image by 400%. Look at the edges of any letter. Those soft gray pixels are anti-aliasing. Now you know.</p>
                </div>
                <p>The purpose of anti-aliasing is to fool the eye into seeing type as smoothly rounded in spite of the low resolution of computer monitors.</p>
                <p>Anti-aliasing is also used for images unless you’re deliberately going for a bitmapped, pixellated look. And you’re usually not. Whether for type or images, it can cause problems when working with <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> transparency.</p>
                <h6>Exercise 5: Match 'Em Up</h6>
                <div class="exercise">
                    <p>Open Photoshop and create a new blank document with a white background.</p>
                    <p>Choose any two web-safe colors from the Photoshop Color Picker or the VisiBone web palette. For the sake of argument, we’ll choose a dark purple and a light green.</p>
                    <p>Select a circular area and fill it with the foreground color (dark purple).</p>
                    <p>Save the image as circle.psd.</p>
                    <p>Hide the Background layer so that it becomes transparent.</p>
                    <p>Save for Web.</p>
                    <p>Choose <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> (choosy mothers choose <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>) and click the Transparency checkbox.</p>
                    <p>Select the background (light green) color as your transparency color.</p>
                    <p>Optimize at 16 colors with dithering on and the web-safe slider dragged to about 40% web-safe.</p>
                    <p>Save the image as circle.gif.</p>
                    <p>Open BBEdit or your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> editor of choice.</p>
                    <p>Create a new basic <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document with a background color to match the light green (transparent) background of your <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image.</p>
                    <p>Save the file as circle.html.</p>
                    <p>Open it in any web browser.</p>
                    <p>The circle should look good and should have a soft edge thanks to anti-aliasing.</p>
                    <p>Return to the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> document and change the <code class="nopad">&lt;BODY></code> background color to a new, contrasting color. Say, black (#000000).</p>
                    <p>Save the file and reopen it in the web browser.</p>
                    <p>The circle should be surrounded by an ugly light green halo.</p>
                    <p>That is improper anti-aliasing. What have we learned? Always anti-alias against the color you expect to use in the finished web page.</p>
                </div>
                <p>How do you anti-alias a transparent type (or image) <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> when the site uses a gradient background image or a random texture?</p>
                <p>You can’t. So avoid using those types of backgrounds unless you never need to set transparent <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s in the foreground.</p>
                <p>You should avoid gradient background images anyway because they will dither horribly on 256-color monitors, don’t render properly in the <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> format, and if exported as <abbr title="Joint Photographic Experts Group">JPEG</abbr>s cannot be web-safe.</p>
                <p>And you should avoid busy random textured backgrounds as well because they are generally hideous, and they make text harder to read. Even beautiful pages developed with subtle background tiles are not much use if no one can read the text they contain.</p>
                <p>The <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> format mentioned earlier offers real transparency, which means a <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> image could be used against any type of web background without ill effect. But the trouble with <abbr title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> is...well, we’ve covered that to death already.</p>
                <h3>Specifying Anti-Aliasing for Type</h3>
                <p>Anti-aliasing options in Photoshop and ImageReady allow you to choose from three levels of anti-aliasing to modify the appearance of type online. You can choose to make type appear crisper, smoother, or heavier.</p>
                <h6>Exercise 6: Shape Up—Sizes and Faces</h6>
                <div class="exercise">
                    <p>Create a new type layer by typing in a new, blank Photoshop document.</p>
                    <p>In the Type Tool dialog box, select an anti-aliasing option from the pop-up menu. Choose:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span><strong>None</strong> to apply no anti-aliasing. Useful for bitmapped fonts such as Joe Gillespie’s Mini 7 (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101240743/http://www.wpdfd.com/mini7.htm" title="Check out what wpdfd.com/mini7.htm looked like back in 2001.">www.wpdfd.com/mini7.htm</a>), Jason Kottke’s Silkscreen (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101232245/http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen" title="Check out what kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen looked like back in 2001.">www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/</a>), or the Fountain Type Foundry’s Sevenet (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200102021447/http://www.fountain.nu" title="Check out what fountain.nu looked like back in 2001.">www.fountain.nu</a>).</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Crisp</strong> to make type appear sharp. This is the default setting. It renders well and uses less bandwidth than Strong or Smooth.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Strong</strong> to make type appear heavier. This is an impressive setting, but because it requires additional anti-aliasing to create its effect, it fights the <abbr title="Lempel Ziv Welch">LZW</abbr> compression algorithm and results in larger file sizes. We are talking about very small differences here, but these differences do add up.</span></li>
                        <li><span><strong>Smooth</strong> to make type appear, well, smoother.</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Experiment with different sizes and faces to get a feeling for which type of anti-aliasing is appropriate for each face, size, and weight. This also varies depending on the background being used, the visual interaction of other elements on the page, and so on. Most web designers choose Crisp most of the time.</p>
                </div>
                <h4>General Tips</h4>
                <p>As just mentioned, the smoother or heavier the anti-aliasing, the greater the number of edge pixels in various shades, and the more bytes the resulting <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image will require. When bandwidth is at a premium—and it is always at a premium—err in the direction of Crisp.</p>
                <p>Not all type needs to be anti-aliased. Smaller type might be easier to read with no anti-aliasing at all. For instance, 10<abbr title="pixel">px</abbr> Helvetica will be easier to read (and will use up less bandwidth) if you choose "None" in the Anti-Aliasing dialog box. But rather than create <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> type of that nature, a more responsible course would be to use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to create small bits of web type because such text may be easily copied, pasted, and indexed by search engines—whereas type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s are simply images.</p>
                <h2>General Hints on Type</h2>
                <p>Pardon the pun. (Get it? Type? Hints? Never mind.) Every aspect of web design involves trade-offs and potential problems for some web users. When setting typography for the Web, here are some points to keep in mind.</p>
                <h3>The Sans of Time</h3>
                <p>Let’s just get it over with: Sans serif fonts are far easier to read onscreen than serif fonts. This is the exact opposite of what is true for books. But printing is high-resolution; the computer screen is low-resolution. There are simply not enough pixels to correctly render the tiny details required by serif typefaces. This is especially true with smaller type, such as body text and subheads. (It is also true for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> text.)</p>
                <p>It helps to think of your type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s as icons, which must be rendered pixel by pixel in a 72<abbr title="pixels-per-inch">ppi</abbr> environment—because that is essentially what they are. Anti-aliased fringe colors must use up an entire pixel (there are no half-pixels). Now add subtle ascenders and descenders to this mix, attempt to wedge such nuances into discreet pixels, and you can see why serifs work poorly onscreen.</p>
                <p>You also can see why typographic colors should be web-safe. Add dithering to the unholy mix of anti-aliasing and serifs, and you have an illegible mess.</p>
                <p>This inherent preference for sans serifs on the Web might be behind the present resurgence in Helvetica. We could be talking through our hats, but we haven’t heard a better theory, and as we’ve shown earlier, web styles have been entering mainstream media as fast as designers could rip each other off.</p>
                <p>From this discussion, it might seem that the Web is no place for fine typography. But that is not the case. Juxt Interactive is one agency that creates superb type treatments online, and their work repays careful study (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101182141/http://www.juxtinteractive.com" title="Check out what juxtinteractive.com looked like back in 2001.">www.juxtinteractive.com</a>).</p>
                <h3>Space Patrol</h3>
                <p>In most cases, web type is more readable when it is widely spaced because such spacing makes allowances for the imprecise spreading of unruly edge pixels. So when setting type, try loosening your tracking in the Type dialog box. If you’ve done any <abbr title="Television">TV</abbr> design, it’s pretty much the same thing. If you haven’t, just trust us.</p>
                <h3>Lest We Fail to Repeat Ourselves</h3>
                <p>Always start with web-safe colors for your type and your background to avoid ugly dithering in low-end monitors.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility, Thy Name Is Text</h3>
                <p>The more text you create graphically, the less a search engine will understand about your client’s web page and the more problems you create for readers with disabilities or those using alternative web browsers.</p>
                <p>As mentioned elsewhere in this book, use <code class="nopad">&lt;ALT></code> and <code class="nopad">&lt;TITLE></code> attributes in your <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> <code class="nopad">&lt;IMG></code> tags to explain what the search engine and the disabled visitor cannot see. If <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and a text <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> look equally good, choose <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> because it increases the accessibility and usability of your page, makes it easier for search engines to locate the relevant information, and almost invariably uses less bandwidth than graphics.</p>
                <p>In most cases, <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text can be resized by the user. Type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s cannot. Keep in mind that small type that looks great to you might be difficult or impossible for folks with impaired vision to read.</p>
                <p>If you were wondering why you see so much large bold sans serif typography on the web, now you know. It’s not that web designers are copycats. Well, we are, but it’s not <em>just</em> that. It’s that we’ve learned by experience that small fonts, sans serif fonts, and tightly kerned text can all be problematic for the people who use our sites.</p>
                <p>As support for <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> improves, it becomes a little easier to sell clients on <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>-style text instead of type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s. But resistance to this notion is widespread because clients seek branding, and designers like creating it. And, most of the time, type <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr>s just work better for that purpose, regardless of their accessibility issues.</p>
                <h2>Navigation: Charting the Visitor's Course</h2>
                <p>We covered the guiding principles of navigation in <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">Chapter 3</a>, "Where Am I? Navigation & Interface." And in <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a>, "Riding the Project Life Cycle," we learned that developing a branded, intuitive navigational menu—or a series of hierarchical navigation menus—is only the beginning and that most web firms perform interface testing, asking volunteers to work with the developing site. And as problems are identified, the designer is asked to rethink and redesign.</p>
                <p>Focus group testing in advertising often results in mediocre campaigns, but focus group testing of a web interface can result in a better site—if those who run the tests know what they are doing.</p>
                <p>What this means in the context of Photoshop is that you will be creating a lot of comps until you truly crack the interface problem, and then you will be refining your comps based on feedback from user tests.</p>
                <p>When the perfect interface has been designed in Photoshop, there is still more to do. Often, the design team will implement a menu bar that <em>changes state</em> via JavaScript as the visitor navigates the site. On the simplest level, changing state means that the menu bar subtly indicates where the user is within the site structure. For instance, when the visitor reaches the About section of PlanetRX (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101300847/http://www.planetrx.com/information/about.html" title="Check out what planetrx.com/information/about.html looked like back in 2001.">http://www.planetrx.com/information/about.html</a>), the About portion of the menu bar is highlighted to remind the visitor "you are here." Refer back to <a href="3.html" title="Check out chapter 3.">Chapter 3</a>’s Figures 3.2 and 3.3 to see how this "you are here" state change is handled on the Gap site.</p>
                <p>Changing state to reinforce the visitor’s position within the site can be accomplished by simple <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, via JavaScript, or with the help of publishing systems that swap visual elements on-the-fly. The choice of implementation varies by the scope of the site and the size of the budget. On a small site, the menu bar can be changed via <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or JavaScript. On a very large site that is constantly updated, a publishing system will probably be used.</p>
                <p>No matter how the technique is implemented, it is up to the designer to create the alternate state graphics on separate layers in the Photoshop document. (These will come in handy later in the process when the work is sliced and produced in ImageReady.)</p>
                <p>Typical navigation menus also "light up" or otherwise change state when the user drags the mouse cursor over a given menu item selection. Again, this is accomplished via JavaScript, and again, though there is no substitute for home-cooked code (or working with good developers), ImageReady can help out, as we are about to see.</p>
                <h2>Slicing and Dicing</h2>
                <p>Photoshop is the primary tool used to design navigational menus and their associated text (unless these menus are created in <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, per the preceding discussion). Photoshop and Illustrator are also used to create assorted navigational elements such as arrows and buttons. The larger and more commercial the site, the greater the pressure to create uniquely branded elements.</p>
                <p>These elements can be created in separate image documents. For instance, you might create hundreds of arrows in Illustrator before choosing one for your design. Similarly, you might (and probably will) go through several rounds of logo development.</p>
                <p>But after they are created and chosen, all of these elements are generally layered into a single Photoshop comp, which is used to sell the work to the client (see Figure 9.13). Of course, as we’ve just said (and as <a href="7.html" title="Check out chapter 7.">Chapter 7</a> explained), this "selling" is a multistage process, with continual refinement occurring based on research, user testing, and the client’s strange whims.</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="9.13.png" alt="Figure 9.13" class="large-6 columns">
                    <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                        <h6>Figure 9.13</h6>
                        <p>Here is a Photoshop web layout that combines photography, logos, and interface elements. We used this layout to sell a final web design to JazzRadio.Net (<a href="//web.archive.org/web/200012080428/http://www.jazzradio.net/indexf.html" title="Check out what jazzradio.net looked like back in 2000.">www.jazzradio.net</a>).</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">After it’s sold, production begins, and at this point Photoshop’s ImageReady module comes into its own. Knives were made to slice cake, and ImageReady was made to slice web comps. The process begins by dragging Photoshop guidelines across any area that will have to be sliced—for instance, dragging guidelines to separate one menu bar item from the next (see Figure 9.14).</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="9.14.png" alt="Figure 9.14" class="large-6 columns">
                    <figcaption class="large-6 columns">
                        <h6>Figure 9.14</h6>
                        <p>The next phase is dragging Photoshop’s guides to mark areas to be converted to slices in the ImageReady module. (Photoshop 6 can create the slices itself.) Though slicing such comps is the normal next step, for this project we opened a text editor and re-created the layout in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> to minimize bandwidth and enable the layout to squash or stretch in true "liquid" fashion.</p>
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p class="clearfix">With Photoshop 6, you can create and name slices right in the Photoshop program itself. With Photoshop 5.5, having dragged guides, you "Jump to ImageReady" via the File menu and automatically convert your guides to slices at the touch of a button. ImageReady generates the relevant <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, animations (if any), and JavaScript rollover functions (if any). We don’t mean to imply that this happens instantly, of course. There is a great deal of typing, dragging, and layer selection involved.</p>
                <p>Rollovers are created by selecting new layers for each rollover state and typing the relevant <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> and text (if any) in the Slices dialog box. Now you can see why rollover states are visually designed during the comping phase. Not only does this satisfy the client, it also enables you to focus on production tasks without worrying about previously unconsidered design issues.</p>
                <p>Performing all these production tasks is a fairly straightforward process, and the Photoshop manual spells it out so completely that we won’t bother doing so here. One thing Photoshop’s manual does not emphasize (but we will) is that you can often replace selected slices with bandwidth-friendly <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> equivalents. For example, instead of generating a large brown <abbr title="Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image, you can generate an empty table cell filled with the appropriate background color, merely by choosing No Image from the Type drop-down menu.</p>
                <p>This by no means converts a browser-centric, brand-heavy site into a light, accessible one. It does, however, help reduce overall file size, and it does make life a bit easier for those using nontraditional browsers, given that this will be one less pointless image to trouble them with its incomprehensibility.</p>
                <p>After the process is completed, sophisticated web designers take the <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and JavaScript generated by ImageReady, open it in an <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> text editor such as BBEdit, PageSpinner, or HomeSite, and edit as needed. For example, you might substitute a simpler JavaScript function for one generated by ImageReady.</p>
                <p>ImageReady’s JavaScript is verily a two-edged sword. Novices and experienced web designers in a hurry can rightly consider ImageReady’s automated scripting a godsend. But it is equally easy to generate massively confusing or even completely dysfunctional scripts until you familiarize yourself with the process. The first time we used ImageReady to automatically generate image rollovers, we ended up with a folder full of bizarrely named duplicate slices and a script that changed every image on the page at the slightest movement of the mouse.</p>
                <p><em>Then</em> we read the manual.</p>
                <p>Most professionals will use ImageReady to generate slices and raw <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, then tighten up its markup for better standards compliance and lower bandwidth, and replace its often complex scripts with simpler ones. In large web agencies, web technicians will perform these tasks.</p>
                <h2>Thinking Semantically</h2>
                <p>Photoshop and ImageReady perform vital tasks splendidly, but what they cannot do is generate semantic websites predicated on the separation of style from content. Being visual tools, they necessarily create visual sites—and of course this is what most clients want and what most designers are comfortable with. But this is not the only way and not necessarily the best way to create websites.</p>
                <p>Visual sites are a comforting link to the past, to our history of print and package design—of concrete objects made beautiful and intelligible through precise design. Semantic sites are something else again.</p>
                <p>Because they are rooted in images, and images are necessarily of fixed and specific sizes, Photoshop and ImageReady generate image-laden sites laid out in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tables with specific heights and widths. They do not generate the Liquid Design we discussed in <a href="2.html" title="Check out chapter 2.">Chapter 2</a> because it is not in the nature of a pixel-based program to develop abstractions of form. And certainly they cannot separate style from content because style <em>is</em> their content.</p>
                <p>So separating style from content becomes your job, if you choose to accept it. As an interim step, what we’ve done in our shop over the past two years is confine ImageReady’s slicing skills to key elements that must be precisely sized—for instance, to branded navigational menu bars. But whenever possible, instead of slicing entire comps to create precise graphic web layouts, we use our comps as guidelines to create <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (or, even better) <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> equivalents that are loose, flexible, and fairly minimalist.</p>
                <p>This process enables us to create templates that function as "content containers." Such sites are still branded and still function as all sites function, but they are less tied down by fixed elements than traditional sites. This makes them easier to revise and update (just change a style sheet) and harder for clients to screw up when they take over the maintenance chores. It also makes them easier for nontraditional browsers to process and positions them for the next phase of web development.</p>
                <p>We have now broached the vital next step in the web’s history: the separation of style from content. Meanwhile, in our discussion of web typography, we have so far avoided the specifics of coping with actual web texts as opposed to decorative elements. So maybe it’s time to look at a technology that handles both the separation of style from content <em>and</em> the need for precise typographic control of web text.</p>
                <p>The people of earth call it <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and the next chapter will explain how it works—and what to do when it stops working.</p>
