                <h2 class="alt">Acknowledgments</h2>
                <p>I cannot possibly name all the people whose creativity has inspired me, or those I’ve been lucky enough to collaborate with over the years. It would take hundreds of pages to properly thank those I’ve worked with this year alone.</p>
                <p>In childhood, I attended a wedding where the bride and groom thanked the special people in their lives. In the flush of the moment, they forgot to name one friend. He harbored a resentment that deepened over the years. Ultimately, a tragedy ensued, in which innocent bystanders lost their lives. But I digress.</p>
                <p>Rather than make a similar mistake, I’m going to deliberately omit the names of many special people who contributed to my knowledge of the Web and thus, however unwittingly, to this book. Even if you are not named below, I love you and am grateful to you, and you should buy this book regardless.</p>
                <p>To Steve Crozier of Populi, who envisioned an intelligent method of teaching web design, and to Margaret Alston and Cheryl Stockton, who collaborated with me on the development of the Populi Curriculum, my sincere and endless thanks.</p>
                <p>My deep gratitude to Michael Nolan for asking me to write this book. To Michael and Karen Whitehouse for shepherding it safely through the minefields of the publishing industry. To development editor Victoria Elzey for keeping it real. And to my friend and this book’s technical editor Steven Champeon for finding all the mistakes and not telling anyone but me.</p>
                <p>To my beloved friends Fred Gates, Leigh and TJ Baker-Foley, and Katherine Sullivan: thank you for sharing your lives, keeping me sane, and forgiving the disappearances, hibernation, and mood swings that accompanied the writing of this book.</p>
                <p>To Jim, who asked only an occasional phone call and got nothing but months of silence: I wrote this book for you, I owe you more than these words express, and I promise to start calling again, really.</p>
                <p>To Don Buckley, my friend and first web client, and to my first web design partners, Steve McCarron and Alec Pollak, sincere thanks and respect.</p>
                <p>All web designers owe thanks to Glenn Davis for contributions too numerous to describe here. Similarly, respect and thanks to George Olsen, Teresa Martin, and Michael Sweeney. You know what you did.</p>
                <p>Love, thanks, and respect to Brian M. Platz, co-founder of A List Apart back when it was a mailing list for web designers. To Bruce Livingstone, Nick Finck, Webchick, and Erin Kissane, who help keep <abbr title="A List Apart">ALA</abbr> going. And to the fine writers who make it worth reading, including Joe Clark, J. David Eisenberg, Curt Cloninger, Alan Herrell, Scott Kramer, Jeffrey Veen, John Allsopp, Robin Miller, Denice Warren, Jason Kottke, Lance Arthur, Glenn Davis, Alyce McPartland, Ryan Holsten, Julia Hayden, Peter-Paul Koch, Wayne Bremser, D.K. Robinson, L. Michelle Johnson, Mattias Konradsson, Steven Champeon (again), Chris Schmitt, Marlene Bruce, Lee Moyer, Bob Stein, Dave Linabury, Mark Newhouse, Bob Jacobson, Erika Meyer, Ross Olson, Rich Robinson, Bill Humphries, Scott Cohen, Peter Balogh, Robert Miller, Shoshannah L. Forbes, Pär Almqvist, Simon St. Laurent, Jennifer Lindner, Nick Finck (again), Jim Byrne, Makiko Itoh, Ben Henick, George Olsen (again), and Chris MacGregor.</p>
                <p>Thanks to everyone who’s ever looked at any site I’ve had a hand in creating, and especially to those who’ve written (even if you wrote to say it stank). Thanks to all the web designers and developers who joined The Web Standards Project.</p>
                <p>Hello? Thanks to Tim Berners-Lee for inventing the Web. Thanks to the Web’s first teachers: Jeffrey Veen (again), Glenn Davis (again), Dan Shafer, David Siegel, and Lynda Weinman. Thanks to Jim Heid and Steve Broback of Thunder Lizard for support, encouragement, great programs, and fine hotel accommodations.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Michael Schmidt and Toke Nygaard for the secret work you did on this book, for the incredible work you do on the Web, and for your friendship. Similar thanks to the incredible Carlos Segura.</p>
                <p>Thanks to Todd Fahrner and Tantek Çelik for contributing to my knowledge and (more importantly) to the sane advancement of the Web. Likewise, each in their own way: Tim Bray, Steven Champeon (again), Rachel Cox, B.K. DeLong, Sally Khudairi, Tom Negrino, Dori Smith, Simon St. Laurent, Eric Meyer, Eric Costello, J. David Eisenberg (again), Dave Winer, Stewart Butterfield, Carl Malamud, Joe Jenett, Evan Williams, Robert Scoble, and Peter-Paul Koch (again).</p>
                <p>Huge shout-outs to my supremely talented web designer pals. I value your friendship and love your work. You know who you are, and if you didn’t know you might get a clue from the fact that I am always linking to you or referring obliquely to you, and if that’s not enough, you’ll find yourselves in the Exit Gallery at <a href="//web.archive.org/web/200101261444id_/http://www.zeldman.com" title="Check out what zeldman.com looked like back in 2001.">zeldman.com</a>.</p>
                <p>The paragraph above and the one you’re now reading constitute the toughest part of writing this book. In the six years I’ve spent designing websites, I’ve met or corresponded with tens of thousands of talented people, worked with or gotten close to hundreds. I can’t list you all. This is so painful I feel like canceling the book, but my publisher insists otherwise. Please accept these tragically empty paragraphs as my attempt to embrace you all in love and gratitude.</p>
                <p>Love and thanks to Peyo Almqvist, Derek Powazek, Josh Davis, Heather Champ, Daniel Bogan, Craig Hockenberry, Lance Arthur, Michael Cina, Heather Hesketh, Dave Linabury, Dan Licht, Brian Alvey, Shauna Wright, Halcyon, Hasan, Matt, Jason, Big Dave, Lmichelle, Fish Sauce, Toke, Michael, Leigh, and Uncle Joe.</p>
