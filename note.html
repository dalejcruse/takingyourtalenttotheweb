                <h2 class="alt">Web vs. Print: A Note About <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr></h2>
                <p>The Web is an ever-changing flow of ideas, designs, and redesigns. Sites evolve and decay. Some move to new locations. Others disappear. By the time you read this book, some of the sites it describes will surely have changed, while others may have vanished altogether.</p>
                <p>This flow and flux is natural to the Web, and in some ways it is even healthy. It’s good when mediocre sites improve, and it’s inevitable that pointless sites (like pointless products) eventually fade away.</p>
                <p>But healthy and natural or not, the medium’s constant dynamism can wreak havoc with books about the Web, and thus with those books’ readers. You read about an interesting design or technological decision, fire up your web browser, and discover that the site no longer demonstrates what was discussed in the book.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, dear reader, you can minimize the damage by bearing these things in mind:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>Most of the concepts and techniques discussed here are fairly widespread. If Site A no longer sports a nifty rollover technique we’ve described, you’ll probably find it at Site B or Site C. The principles are more important than the specific examples.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Sites should not arbitrarily change page locations, but unfortunately, many do. If a particular web page seems to have disappeared, try factoring the <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to a simpler version. For instance, if <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060412162209/http://games.yahoo.com/games/front" title="Check out what yahoo.com/games/thrills looked like back in 2006, because we couldn't find an earlier cached copy.">www.yahoo.com/games/thrills/</a> no longer works, go back to its purest form, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/200101240005/http://www.yahoo.com" title="Check out what yahoo.com looked like back in 2001.">www.yahoo.com/</a>, and see if you can navigate to the page’s new location that way.</span></li>
                    <li><span>Finally, if a site we’ve hailed as an example of creative excellence or touted as a superb resource for further learning seems to have disappeared, try visiting the zeldman.com Exit Gallery at <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/200102040016/http://www.zeldman.com/exit.html" title="Check out what zeldman.com/exit.html looked like back in 2001.">www.zeldman.com/exit.html</a>. If the site is truly special and has moved to a new location on the Web, you’ll find that new address in our Exit Gallery. If the site has actually changed its name, we’ll mention the former name to help you get your bearings.</span></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Now go forth, design, and conquer.</p>
